# A workflow that implements similar logic to actions/stale.
#
# Compared to actions/stale, it is implemented to make API requests proportional
# to the number of stale PRs, not the total number of issues in the repo. This
# is because PyTorch has a lot of issues/PRs, so the actions/stale runs into
# rate limits way too quickly.
#
# The behavior is:
# - If a PR is not labeled stale, after 60 days inactivity label the PR as stale and comment about it.
# - If a PR is labeled stale, after 30 days inactivity close the PR.
# - `high priority` and `no-stale` PRs are exempt.
