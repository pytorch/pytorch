        #### Before submitting a bug, please make sure the issue hasn't been already addressed by searching through [the
        existing and past issues](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues)
        It's likely that your bug will be resolved by checking our FAQ or troubleshooting guide [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/dynamo/index.html)

        Note: if you're submitting an issue that you generated from a fuzzer. Please do the following:

        - Ensure rtol/atol are at default tolerances

        - Don't compare indices of max/min etc, because that avoids the above requirement

        - If comparing eager and torch.compile at fp16/bf16, you should use fp32 as baseline

        If the above requirements are met, add the label "topic: fuzzer" to your issue.

        for guidance on what to additionally include. In particular, consider including:

        - The `tlparse` for your program
        - Ablation - which `torch.compile` backend/mode/settings cause the bug
        - A minimal reproducer
