// format, however their usage is different.
//
// ModelProto files are used to describe executable graphs that can be
// executed directly by a framework, runtime, or engine.

// OperatorSetProto files are used to describe a set of operators that are
// available in a given environment.  The file TBD.TBD is the OperatorSetProto
// that describes the ONNX standard operators.
