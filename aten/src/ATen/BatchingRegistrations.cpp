// NOTE: [What is a batching rule?]
//
// A *batching rule* implements the logic of how to call an operator on inputs
// that have zero or more additional batch dimensions. When one does a vmap, the
// dimension(s) being vmap'ed over get recorded as batch dimensions.
//
// For example, vmap(torch.add)(x, y)
// 1. wraps `x` into batched_x = BatchedTensor(x, bdims=[(lvl=1, dim=0)];
// 2. wraps `y` into batched_y = BatchedTensor(y, bdims=[(lvl=1, dim=0)];
// 3. and then runs `torch.add(batched_x, batched_y)`.

// NOTE: [When should I add a batching rule?]
// When you are adding a new operator, you'll need to add a batching rule so
// that vmap can work efficiently with said operator. If you do not, we'll attempt
// to generate a slow fallback for the batching rule (this is not yet implemented).

// NOTE: [How to write batching rules?]
// The signature of a batching rule should look like exactly like the C++ signature
// of its operator.
//
// First, see NOTE: [Logical vs physical args] in VmapTransforms.h for terminology.
//
// At a high level, what a batching rule does is the following:
// 1. Converts (logical) BatchedTensors to views on physical tensors.
// 2. Converts logical arguments (e.g. dimension indexes, shapes) to physical
//    arguments that correspond to the physical tensors.
// 3. Calls at:: operations on the physical tensors and arguments to produce
//    some physical results.
// 4. Converts physical results back to BatchedTensors.
//
// Steps 1, 2, and 4 differ for operators with different batching behaviors. When
// writing a new batching rule, please select a VmapTransform that matches the
// batching behavior of your operation. The VmapTransform provides helper functions
// to do steps (1), (2), and (4).
// (see NOTE: [What is an VmapTransform?] in VmapTransforms.h)

// Note: [Future plans]
// The API for writing a batching rule isn't stable. In the future, we'd like
// to think about the problem of translating these batching rules to TorchScript.
// Ideally batching rules in eager mode vs TorchScript would look pretty similar,
// if not use the same mechanism. In order to accomplish that we might have to
// do some refactoring.
