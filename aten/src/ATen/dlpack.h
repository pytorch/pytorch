 *
 * A change in minor version indicates that we have added new
 * code, such as a new device type, but the ABI is kept the same.
 *
 * If an obtained DLPack tensor has a major version that disagrees
 * with the version number specified in this header file
 * (i.e. major != DLPACK_MAJOR_VERSION), the consumer must call the deleter
 * (and it is safe to do so). It is not safe to access any other fields
 * as the memory layout will have changed.
 *
 * In the case of a minor version mismatch, the tensor can be safely used as
 * long as the consumer knows how to interpret all fields. Minor version

 * with `PyLong_FromVoidPtr`/`PyLong_AsVoidPtr`.
 *

 * \code

 * PyObject *api_obj = type(tensor_obj).__c_dlpack_exchange_api__;  // as C-code
 * MyDLPackExchangeAPI *api = PyLong_AsVoidPtr(api_obj);
 * if (api == NULL && PyErr_Occurred()) { goto handle_error; }
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that this must be defined on the type. The consumer should look up the
 * attribute on the type and may cache the result for each unique type.
 *
 * The precise API table is given by:
 * \code
 * struct MyDLPackExchangeAPI : public DLPackExchangeAPI {
 *   MyDLPackExchangeAPI() {
 *     header.version.major = DLPACK_MAJOR_VERSION;
 *     header.version.minor = DLPACK_MINOR_VERSION;

 *     static MyDLPackExchangeAPI inst;
 *     return &inst;
 *  }
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * Guidelines for leveraging DLPackExchangeAPI:
 *
 * There are generally two kinds of consumer needs for DLPack exchange:
 * - N0: library support, where consumer.kernel(x, y, z) would like to run a kernel
 *       with the data from x, y, z. The consumer is also expected to run the kernel with the same
 *       stream context as the producer. For example, when x, y, z is torch.Tensor,
 *       consumer should query exchange_api->current_work_stream to get the
 *       current stream and launch the kernel with the same stream.
 *       This setup is necessary for no synchronization in kernel launch and maximum compatibility
 *       with CUDA graph capture in the producer.
 *       This is the desirable behavior for library extension support for frameworks like PyTorch.
 * - N1: data ingestion and retention
 *
 * Note that obj.__dlpack__() API should provide useful ways for N1.
 * The primary focus of the current DLPackExchangeAPI is to enable faster exchange N0
 * with the support of the function pointer current_work_stream.
 *
 * Array/Tensor libraries should statically create and initialize this structure
 * then return a pointer to DLPackExchangeAPI as an int value in Tensor/Array.
 * The DLPackExchangeAPI* must stay alive throughout the lifetime of the process.
 *
 * One simple way to do so is to create a static instance of DLPackExchangeAPI
 * within the framework and return a pointer to it. The following code
 * shows an example to do so in C++. It should also be reasonably easy
 * to do so in other languages.
