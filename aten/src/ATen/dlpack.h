 * \brief The DLPack version.
 *
 * A change in major version indicates that we have changed the
 * data layout of the ABI - DLManagedTensorVersioned.
 *
 * A change in minor version indicates that we have added new
 * code, such as a new device type, but the ABI is kept the same.
 *
 * If an obtained DLPack tensor has a major version that disagrees
 * with the version number specified in this header file
 * (i.e. major != DLPACK_MAJOR_VERSION), the consumer must call the deleter
 * (and it is safe to do so). It is not safe to access any other fields
 * as the memory layout will have changed.
 *
 * In the case of a minor version mismatch, the tensor can be safely used as
 * long as the consumer knows how to interpret all fields. Minor version
 * updates indicate the addition of enumeration values.
