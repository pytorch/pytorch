# AOTInductor: Ahead-Of-Time Compilation for Torch.Export-ed Models

```{warning}
AOTInductor and its related features are in prototype status and are
subject to backwards compatibility breaking changes.
```

AOTInductor is a specialized version of
[TorchInductor](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-a-pytorch-native-compiler-with-define-by-run-ir-and-symbolic-shapes/747),
designed to process exported PyTorch models, optimize them, and produce shared libraries as well
as other relevant artifacts.
These compiled artifacts are specifically crafted for deployment in non-Python environments,
which are frequently employed for inference deployments on the server side.

In this tutorial, you will gain insight into the process of taking a PyTorch model, exporting it,
compiling it into an artifact, and conducting model predictions using C++.

## Model Compilation

To compile a model using AOTInductor, we first need to use
{func}`torch.export.export` to capture a given PyTorch model into a
computational graph. {ref}`torch.export <torch.export>` provides soundness
guarantees and a strict specification on the IR captured, which AOTInductor
relies on.

We will then use {func}`torch._inductor.aoti_compile_and_package` to compile the
exported program using TorchInductor, and save the compiled artifacts into one
package. The package is in the format of a {ref}`PT2 Archive Spec <export.pt2_archive>`.

```{note}
If you have a CUDA-enabled device on your machine and you installed PyTorch with CUDA support,
the following code will compile the model into a shared library for CUDA execution.
Otherwise, the compiled artifact will run on CPU. For better performance during CPU inference,
it is suggested to enable freezing by setting `export TORCHINDUCTOR_FREEZING=1`
before running the Python script below. The same behavior works in an environment with IntelÂ®
GPU as well.
```

```python
import os
import torch

class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(10, 16)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(16, 1)
        self.sigmoid = torch.nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.sigmoid(x)
        return x

with torch.no_grad():
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    model = Model().to(device=device)
    example_inputs=(torch.randn(8, 10, device=device),)
    batch_dim = torch.export.Dim("batch", min=1, max=1024)
    # [Optional] Specify the first dimension of the input x as dynamic.
    exported = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs, dynamic_shapes={"x": {0: batch_dim}})
    # [Note] In this example we directly feed the exported module to aoti_compile_and_package.
    # Depending on your use case, e.g. if your training platform and inference platform
    # are different, you may choose to save the exported model using torch.export.save and
    # then load it back using torch.export.load on your inference platform to run AOT compilation.
    output_path = torch._inductor.aoti_compile_and_package(
        exported,
        # [Optional] Specify the generated shared library path. If not specified,
        # the generated artifact is stored in your system temp directory.
        package_path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "model.pt2"),
    )
```

In this illustrative example, the `Dim` parameter is employed to designate the first dimension of
the input variable "x" as dynamic. Notably, the path and name of the compiled library remain unspecified,
resulting in the shared library being stored in a temporary directory.
To access this path from the C++ side, we save it to a file for later retrieval within the C++ code.

## Inference in Python

There are multiple ways to deploy the compiled artifact for inference, and one of that is using Python.
We have provided a convenient utility API in Python {func}`torch._inductor.aoti_load_package` for loading
and running the artifact, as shown in the following example:

```python
import os
import torch

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = torch._inductor.aoti_load_package(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "model.pt2"))
print(model(torch.randn(8, 10, device=device)))
```

The input at inference time should have the same size, dtype, and stride as the input at export time.

## Inference in C++

Next, we use the following example C++ file `inference.cpp` to load the compiled artifact,
enabling us to conduct model predictions directly within a C++ environment.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <torch/csrc/inductor/aoti_package/model_package_loader.h>

int main() {
    c10::InferenceMode mode;

    torch::inductor::AOTIModelPackageLoader loader("model.pt2");
    // Assume running on CUDA
    std::vector<torch::Tensor> inputs = {torch::randn({8, 10}, at::kCUDA)};
    std::vector<torch::Tensor> outputs = loader.run(inputs);
    std::cout << "Result from the first inference:"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << outputs[0] << std::endl;

    // The second inference uses a different batch size and it works because we
    // specified that dimension as dynamic when compiling model.pt2.
    std::cout << "Result from the second inference:"<< std::endl;
    // Assume running on CUDA
    std::cout << loader.run({torch::randn({1, 10}, at::kCUDA)})[0] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

For building the C++ file, you can make use of the provided `CMakeLists.txt` file, which
automates the process of invoking `python model.py` for AOT compilation of the model and compiling
`inference.cpp` into an executable binary named `aoti_example`.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18 FATAL_ERROR)
project(aoti_example)

find_package(Torch REQUIRED)

add_executable(aoti_example inference.cpp model.pt2)

add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT model.pt2
    COMMAND python ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/model.py
    DEPENDS model.py
)

target_link_libraries(aoti_example "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")
set_property(TARGET aoti_example PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 17)
```

Provided the directory structure resembles the following, you can execute the subsequent commands
to construct the binary. It is essential to note that the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable
is crucial for CMake to locate the LibTorch library, and it should be set to an absolute path.
Please be mindful that your path may vary from the one illustrated in this example.

```
aoti_example/
    CMakeLists.txt
    inference.cpp
    model.py
```

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/python/install/site-packages/torch/share/cmake cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release
```

After the `aoti_example` binary has been generated in the `build` directory, executing it will
display results akin to the following:

```bash
$ ./aoti_example
Result from the first inference:
0.4866
0.5184
0.4462
0.4611
0.4744
0.4811
0.4938
0.4193
[ CUDAFloatType{8,1} ]
Result from the second inference:
0.4883
0.4703
[ CUDAFloatType{2,1} ]
```

## Troubleshooting

Below are some useful tools for debugging AOT Inductor.

```{toctree}
:caption: Debugging Tools
:maxdepth: 1

logging
torch.compiler_aot_inductor_minifier
```

To enable runtime checks on inputs, set the environment variable `AOTI_RUNTIME_CHECK_INPUTS` to 1. This will raise a `RuntimeError` if the inputs to the compiled model differ in size, data type, or strides from those used during export.
