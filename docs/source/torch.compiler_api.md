## torch.compiler.precompile

% precompile is a callable instance (not a plain function), which Sphinx
% autosummary cannot render, so it is documented manually below and
% intentionally omitted from the autosummary block above.

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: precompile(fn, *example_inputs, backend="inductor", tracer="make_fx", decompositions=None)

   Ahead-of-time precompile ``fn`` against example inputs, returning a self-contained,
   runnable Python source string plus an acceleration cache as ``(python_code, cache)``.
   ``fn`` is the whole computation, taking the model(s) as
   explicit arguments, e.g. ``lambda model, x: model(x)`` or a training step. The
   ``nn.Module`` arguments have their parameters/buffers lifted to graph inputs, so no
   weights are baked into the artifact -- you pass the model again at runtime to the
   reloaded callable. Reload with ``torch.compiler.precompile.load`` (below).

   .. note::

      With the default ``make_fx`` tracer, capture is non-strict. Control flow is
      specialized to the example inputs, and shapes are static -- each size is baked in.
      The exception is a tensor dim explicitly marked unbacked (inductor backend only)
      with ``torch._dynamo.decorators.mark_unbacked`` on the inputs before the call; such
      a dim is captured as an unbacked symint, so one artifact serves any runtime size of
      it, and a graph that needs to guard on it fails at capture. Each input's dtype and
      device are specialized too (a runtime mismatch is rejected), and the inductor backend
      additionally specializes on input memory format. See Note [precompile programming
      model] in ``torch/_precompile.py``. ``torch.compiler.precompile`` is distinct from
      ``torch._dynamo.config.caching_precompile`` (a ``torch.compile`` caching mode).

   If ``fn`` runs a backward, the artifact re-runs the whole forward and backward and
   scatters the resulting parameter gradients onto the runtime model's ``parameters()``
   ``.grad`` fields, accumulating (``p.grad += g``) exactly like eager ``.backward()`` --
   so keep your usual ``zero_grad()`` / ``optimizer.step()`` loop. Which params receive a
   grad is fixed at capture time (frozen or non-contributing params stay ``.grad = None``).
   The artifact returns ``fn``'s own result (``None`` for a bare ``.backward()`` step), not
   the gradients.

   :param fn: The whole computation to capture, taking the model(s) and runtime inputs
       as positional arguments.
   :param example_inputs: Example positional arguments to ``fn``; the ``nn.Module``
       arguments are lifted and the rest are the runtime inputs.
   :param backend: ``"inductor"`` (default) lowers through AOTAutograd + Inductor;
       ``"eager"`` keeps the captured ATen graph (layout-flexible, no kernels; shapes
       are still specialized to the example).
   :param tracer: capture front-end. ``"make_fx"`` (default) is a non-strict make_fx
       trace and the only tracer implemented today; ``"dynamo"`` is planned and raises
       ``NotImplementedError`` for now.
   :param decompositions: Optional decomposition table (``dict`` of ``OpOverload`` to a
       decomposition function) forwarded to ``make_fx``; defaults to ``None``.
   :returns: ``(python_code, cache)`` -- a self-contained Python source string (the
       single source of truth for the calling convention) and a binary acceleration
       cache (no weights, no calling-convention metadata; it carries a small
       format/version/backend/code_hash integrity tag that ``load`` verifies).
   :raises PrecompileError: if capture, lowering, or a runtime call violates the
       contract (see the exception below).

   Example::

       python_code, cache = torch.compiler.precompile(lambda m, x: m(x), model, x)
       f = torch.compiler.precompile.load(python_code, cache)
       out = f(model, x)   # pass the model again at runtime
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:method:: precompile.load(python_code, cache)

   Reconstruct a runnable from the ``(python_code, cache)`` pair returned by
   ``precompile``. The calling convention is read from ``python_code`` (the single
   source of truth); ``cache`` only accelerates loading -- it carries only the compiled
   backend artifact (the Inductor bundle for ``backend="inductor"``; empty for
   ``backend="eager"``) and no weights. You pass the model(s) again at runtime.

   .. warning::

      ``load`` runs the artifact as code: it executes ``python_code`` (via ``exec``) and,
      for the inductor backend, primes the kernel caches from the ``cache``. Treat
      ``(python_code, cache)`` as trusted, executable input -- only load a pair you
      produced yourself or otherwise trust, exactly as you would any code you are about to
      run (see Note [precompile programming model], invariant 7). ``load`` also emits a
      per-call warning before it runs.

   :param python_code: The self-contained Python source string returned by ``precompile``.
   :param cache: The binary acceleration cache returned by ``precompile``.
   :returns: A runnable callable with the same calling convention as the captured ``fn``.
       Arguments are matched positionally at both capture and load time; keyword-argument
       calling conventions are not supported.
   :raises PrecompileError: if ``python_code`` is not a valid precompile artifact (it
       fails to parse or is missing its calling-convention metadata), if ``cache`` is
       paired with a different ``python_code`` (mismatched ``backend`` tag or
       ``code_hash``), or if a runtime call violates the precompile contract.
