TorchDynamo Deeper Dive
=======================

What is a guard?
----------------

TorchDynamo operates just-in-time and specializes graphs based on
dynamic properties. For example, the first graph above has the following
guards:

::

   GUARDS:
    - local 'a' TENSOR_MATCH
    - local 'b' TENSOR_MATCH
    - global 'torch' FUNCTION_MATCH

If any of those guards fail, the graph will be recaptured and
recompiled. The interesting guard type there is ``TENSOR_MATCH``, which
checks the following ``torch.Tensor`` properties:

- Python class of the tensor (tensor subclassing, etc)
- dtype
- device
- requires_grad
- dispatch_key (with thread-local includes/excludes applied)
- ndim
- sizes\*
- strides\*

The full specialization mode allows the backend compiler to assume an
entirely static graph. Unfortunately, most backends require this.
Operators which return dynamic shapes will trigger a graph break when
not in dynamic shape mode.

What is Dynamo doing?
---------------------

If you want to understand better what TorchDynamo is doing, you can set:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch._dynamo.config
   import logging

   torch._dynamo.config.log_level = logging.INFO
   torch._dynamo.config.output_code = True

This code triggers useful (but spammy) printouts.

For example, the printouts for the first graph in the ``toy_example``
are:

::

   __compiled_fn_0 <eval_with_key>.1
   opcode         name     target                                                  args              kwargs

   placeholder    b        b                                                       ()                {}

   call_function  lt       <built-in function lt>                                  (sum_1, 0)        {}

At the top you can see the FX graph.
Next, you see the original bytecode of the function, followed by the
modified bytecode generated by TorchDynamo. Finally, you see the guards
which we covered above.

In the modified bytecode, ``__compiled_fn_0`` is the return value of
``my_compiler()`` (the compiled graph). ``__resume_at_30_1`` and
``__resume_at_38_2`` are both generated continuation functions that pick
up execution after a graph break (at bytecode offsets 30 and 38). Each
of these functions take the form:

::

   __resume_at_<offset>:
       ... restore stack state if needed ...
       JUMP_ABSOLUTE <offset> into toy_example
       ... original bytecode of toy_example ...

By generating this `resume_at` function, we force the remainder of the
function to be executed in a new Python frame which recursively
triggers TorchDynamo to restart its capture once execution reaches that
point for the first time.
