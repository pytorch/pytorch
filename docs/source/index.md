PyTorch Documentation
===================================

PyTorch, or `torch` is an open-source machine learning library written in Python that provides a platform for deep learning. It features a dynamic computational graph that allows for flexible model building and debugging.

## Why PyTorch?

PyTorch has become one of the leading deep learning frameworks due to its unique advantages:

- **Dynamic Computational Graph**: Unlike static graph frameworks, PyTorch builds the graph on-the-fly, allowing for more intuitive debugging and flexible model architecture changes.
- **Pythonic Design**: PyTorch integrates seamlessly with the Python ecosystem, making it easy to use with popular libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Research-Friendly**: Its imperative programming style makes it particularly suitable for research, rapid prototyping, and complex model architectures.
- **Strong Community Support**: PyTorch has a vibrant ecosystem of tools, libraries, and pre-trained models.

The sections below will help you get started with PyTorch and offer a deeper dive into its capabilities, allowing you to harness the full power of this versatile framework.
