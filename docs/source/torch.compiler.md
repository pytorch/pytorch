# torch.compiler

`torch.compiler` is a namespace through which some of the internal compiler
methods are surfaced for user consumption. The main function and the feature in
this namespace is `torch.compile`.

`torch.compile` is a PyTorch function introduced in PyTorch 2.x that aims to
solve the problem of accurate graph capturing in PyTorch and ultimately enable
software engineers to run their PyTorch programs faster. `torch.compile` is
written in Python and it marks the transition of PyTorch from C++ to Python.

`torch.compile` leverages the following underlying technologies:

- **TorchDynamo (torch._dynamo)** is an internal API that uses a CPython
  feature called the Frame Evaluation API to safely capture PyTorch graphs.
  Methods that are available externally for PyTorch users are surfaced
  through the `torch.compiler` namespace.
- **TorchInductor** is the default `torch.compile` deep learning compiler
  that generates fast code for multiple accelerators and backends. You
  need to use a backend compiler to make speedups through `torch.compile`
  possible. For NVIDIA, AMD and Intel GPUs, it leverages OpenAI Triton as the key
  building block.
- **AOT Autograd** captures not only the user-level code, but also backpropagation,
  which results in capturing the backwards pass "ahead-of-time". This enables
  acceleration of both forwards and backwards pass using TorchInductor.

:::{note}
In some cases, the terms `torch.compile`, TorchDynamo, `torch.compiler`
might be used interchangeably in this documentation.
:::

As mentioned above, to run your workflows faster, `torch.compile` through
TorchDynamo requires a backend that converts the captured graphs into a fast
machine code. Different backends can result in various optimization gains.
The default backend is called TorchInductor, also known as *inductor*,
TorchDynamo has a list of supported backends developed by our partners,
which can be seen by running `torch.compiler.list_backends()` each of which
with its optional dependencies.

Some of the most commonly used backends include:

**Training & inference backends**
