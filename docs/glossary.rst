   API
     Application Programming Interface. A set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications.
   ATen
     Short for "A Tensor Library". The foundational tensor and mathematical operation library on which all else is built.
   ATen operators
     A set of low-level, tensor-based operators in PyTorch that provide basic building blocks for more complex operations, including element-wise operations, reductions, and linear algebra functions
   Composite Operation
     Same as Compound Operation.
   Compound Kernel
     Opposed to Device Kernels, Compound kernels are usually device-agnostic and belong to Compound Operations.
   Compound Operation
     A Compound Operation is composed of other operations. Its kernel is usually device-agnostic. Normally it doesn't have its own derivative functions defined. Instead, AutoGrad automatically computes its derivative based on operations it uses.
   Custom Operation
     An Operation that is defined by users and is usually a Compound Operation. For example, this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html) details how to create Custom Operations.
   Device Kernel
     Device-specific kernel of a leaf operation.
   JIT
     Just-In-Time Compilation.
   Kernel
     Implementation of a PyTorch operation, specifying what should be done when an operation executes.
   Leaf Operation
     An operation that's considered a basic operation, as opposed to a Compound Operation. Leaf Operation always has dispatch functions defined, usually has a derivative function defined as well.
   Native Operation
     An operation that comes natively with PyTorch ATen, for example aten::matmul.
   Non-Leaf Operation
     Same as Compound Operation.
   Operation
     A unit of work. For example, the work of matrix multiplication is an operation called aten::matmul.
   Tracing
     Using `torch.jit.trace` on a function to get an executable that can be optimized using just-in-time compilation.
   TorchScript
     An interface to the TorchScript JIT compiler and interpreter.
   Scripting
     Using `torch.jit.script` on a function to inspect source code and compile it as TorchScript code.
