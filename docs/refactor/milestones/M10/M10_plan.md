# M10_plan — [Pending Plan Definition]

## Status

**M10 plan has not yet been defined.**

This milestone folder was created during M09 closeout per governance requirements.

## Candidate Scope (Not Authorized)

Based on M09 findings, potential M10 directions include:

1. **Third-Party Risk & License Classification** — Analyze M09 SBOM for license compliance and risk scoring
2. **Automated SBOM Generation in CI** — Prevent SBOM drift with automated regeneration
3. **CVE Scanning Integration** — Correlate SBOM components with vulnerability databases

## Next Steps

1. Await M10 plan definition from governance
2. Define scope boundaries and invariants
3. Obtain authorization to begin
