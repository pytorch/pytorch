# Refactoring Program — Tool Call Log

⚠️ **Historical Note**

This file is the **program-level tool call ledger** for the PyTorch AI-Native Refactoring Program.

Tool call logging was formalized during **M01**.  
All milestones **prior to M01 (M00)** predate standardized tool call capture.

As a result:
- ❌ No historical tool calls are reconstructed here
- ✅ All tool calls from **M01 onward** are logged in:
  - `docs/refactor/milestones/<Mx>/Mx_toolcalls.md`

---

## Logging Rules (Effective M01+)

- Every execution session must be logged **before work begins**
- Each milestone maintains its own authoritative tool log
- This file exists as a **structural anchor**, not a retroactive record

---

**First standardized tool logging milestone:** M01  
**This file intentionally begins empty.**
