# Phase 0 — Pre-Flight Audit (PyTorch)

## Upstream Reference

- Repo: pytorch/pytorch
- Commit: <PASTE HASH HERE>

## Scope

- Read-only structural audit
- No behavior changes
- No build changes
- No CI changes

## Detected Surfaces (Initial)

- Language(s):
- Build system(s):
- CI topology:
- Packaging:
- Test framework(s):

## Known Constraints

- Heavy native build
- CUDA / platform variance
- ABI stability requirements

## Risks

- High blast radius
- Long CI cycles
- Accidental behavior change via tooling

## Outcome

- Establish safe refactoring posture
- Define what *must not change*
