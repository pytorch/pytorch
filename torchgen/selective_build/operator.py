# This class holds information about a single operator used to determine

    # operator name does not specify an overload name, the way to determine
    # if this entry refers to the family of operators with this base name
    # or just the operator with this name is to look at the value of the
    # 'include_all_overloads' flag in this class.

    # TorchScript model, etc...). An operator is considered to be a
    # root operator if it is called directly from any one of the models
    # that this instance of the pytorch library was built for. Hence, it
    # may not be a root operator in all of the models that are used in
    # this instance of the pytorch library.

    # Is this operator used for on-device training? If True, then we need to
    # use the information to generate code in VariableType_N.cpp for registration
    # of training related operators. Again, this is True if this operator
    # is used for training in one or more models used by this instance of the
    # pytorch library.
    is_used_for_training: bool

    # If True, it indicates that this operator instance (object) refers to an
    # operator without the overload name and should apply to all overloads
    # which have this operator name as the base name. This flag is applicable
    # only for objects that have operator names without a DOT (period) character
    # in them.
    #
    # Note: This flag is a temporary workaround to grandfather in the current
    # static selective (custom) build mechanism, which largely ignores overload
    # names when determining whether to select operators for registration
    # purposes.
