# WARNING WARNING: LOOKING TO EDIT THIS FILE?  Think carefully about

# generation.  The parameters here should really only be used
# for "temporary" situations, where we need to temporarily change
# the codegen in some cases because we cannot conveniently update
# all call sites, and are slated to be eliminated once all call
# sites are eliminated.  If you don't have a plan for how to get there,
# DON'T add a new entry here.
