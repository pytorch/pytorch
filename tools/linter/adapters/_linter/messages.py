    Like LintMessage but the .length member allows you to make specific edits to
    one location within a file, not just replace the whole file.

    Linters can generate recursive results - results that contain other results.

    For example, the annotation linter would find two results in this code sample:

        index = Union[Optional[str], int]

    And the first result, `Union[Optional[str], int]`, contains the second one,
    `Optional[str]`, so the first result is recursive but the second is not.

    If --fix is selected, the linter does a cycle of tokenizing and fixing all
    the non-recursive edits until no edits remain.
