# Defines derivative formulas and Python signatures of methods on Variable
#
# Note about possibly confusing nomenclature: An 'output gradient' is the
# gradient of an output of a forward function. Output gradients are used as
# the inputs to backward functions. `grads` is a vector of output gradients,
# and `grad == grads[0]`, in all the derivative formulas in this file.
# An 'input gradient' is the gradient of an input to a forward function.
# Input gradients are the outputs of backward functions, corresponding to the
# input names included in the derivative formulas defined in this file.
# Also, every time we talk computing "gradient" we actually mean computing
# the vector jacobian product using the given 'output gradient' as the vector.
#
# Each entry consists of:
#   - A 'name', which specifies the ATen name of the function you
#     are defining derivatives for, and an argument specification.
#   - An optional 'dispatch' entry which can be used to specify
#     per-autograd dispatch key derivatives. If this entry is not
#     specified, then the gradient entries will be taken as the
#     default gradients (i.e. registered for every backward dispatch
#     key). (see _test_autograd_multiple_dispatch for an example
#     of how to register separate derivates for different dispatch keys).
#     The list of allowed dispatch keys (in addition to 'Default' which
#     represents the Autograd alias key) is torchgen/model.py:AUTOGRAD_KEYS.
#   - One or more gradients entries, mapping differentiable input
#     names to a formula specifying how to compute its gradient.
#     Note that a single gradient entry can specify the gradient
#     formula for multiple input names, by specifying a key
#     "input1, input2" (see atan2 for an example).
#   - An argument can be flagged as 'non_differentiable'.
#   - Optional entry with key 'output_differentiability' and value a list of the
#     same length as the number of outputs from the forward function. The list
#     should contain only booleans, specifying whether each of the output Tensor
#     is differentiable.
#     If it is not specified for a function that returns multiple elements but
#     uses `grad` instead of `grads[idx]`, then all but the first output will
#     be marked as non-differentiable.
#     If None of the output is differentiable, you can also add the function
#     name to `gen_variable_type.py`'s `DONT_REQUIRE_DERIVATIVE` list.
#
# There are two cases for Tensor and TensorList arguments here:
#   - If that argument is differentiable, in the sense that a gradient with respect
#     to that argument could exist. You should either:
#       - Specify the formula for that gradient
#       - Specify not_implemented("function_name") as a formula to say that this is not
#         implement yet (but might be in the future and the user can request that on an issue)
#   - If that argument is not differentiable, because it is not a floating point dtype or the
#     function is not differentiable with respect to that argument  for
#     example. You should either:
#       - Do not specify any formula for this argument
#       - Specify explicitly that this argument is "non_differentiable". Note that in this case,
#         we trust you that this argument will never have requires_grad=True and it will be silently
#         ignored if it does.
#
# If a function has out-of-place and in-place variants, then the derivative
# definition for the in-place variant is optional. It will default to the
# definition for the out-of-place variant. Note that _out variants are never
# differentiable.
#
# Gradient expressions are standard C++ expressions operating on ATen
# variables.  In a gradient expression, the following variables are in
# scope:
#
#   - 'grad', the gradient of the output (often spelled grad_output
#     in Python) which we are going to left-multiply.
#
#     When a function returns multiple *differentiable* outputs,
#     you can refer to the gradients of each outputs using 'grads',
#     e.g., 'grads[0]', 'grads[1]'.
#
#     When a function returns multiple *differentiable* outputs that
#     are named, you can refer to the gradients of each outputs using
#     'grad_{name}', e.g., 'grad_x', 'grad_y'.
#
#     When a function returns *one* differentiable output (the
#     first output) and some more nondifferentiable outputs,
#     you MUST refer to the gradient of the differentiable output with
#     'grad' (this case is special-cased in our code generation).
#
#     Note that the number of differentibale outputs can be modified by the
#     'output_differentiability' entry (see above).
#
#     Across a differentiable function's derivatives set, it is not
#     permitted to mix the use of "grad", "grads", and
#     "grad_{name}". You must be consistent for that differentiable
#     function.
#
#   - Any of the input arguments, tensor or non-tensor, including
#     argument names that only appear in Declarations.yaml, e.g. 'output'.
#
#   - 'result', representing the result of evaluating the forward
#     expression for ATen native function declarations. If the forward
#     expression outputs a tuple, use 'resultX' instead to access the
#     X-th entry
#
#   - 'grad_input_mask', a std::array<bool, n>, specifies which input
#     gradients are actually needed.  For example, in the entry
#     `input0, input1: foo(grad_input_mask)`, `grad_input_mask` is a size
#     two array, where `grad_input_mask[0]` is true if `input0` requires
#     grad, and `grad_input_mask[1]` is true if `input1` requires grad.
#
#     (NB: if your function computes gradient for a list of tensors,
#     the `grad_input_mask` will only have a single entry for the list
#     specifying if either zero or at least one tensor from the list requires
#     grad.  If we want to support more fine-grained signalling,
#     we'll need some alternate variable which is not a std::array)
#
#   - 'retain_variables', a bool which is true if a user has specified
#     that saved variables should be retained in case the backwards is
#     run again later.  This allows an optimization where we can
#     destroy saved buffers if we know variables are not going to be retained,
#     e.g., it is used by _cudnn_rnn
#
# If you need a complex expression, e.g., with local variables,
# write a _backward function in torch/csrc/autograd/FunctionsManual.cpp
# and invoke it from here.  By the way, go read
# https://github.com/zdevito/ATen/issues/163; this describes an
# important hazard that occurs when porting backwards from Python to C++
#
# Double backwards gradient expressions can be somewhat confusing;
# the most important thing to remember is: (1) you need to define a
# derivative formula for every input, including inputs named things
# like 'grad_output', and (2) the gradient to multiply with is always
# called 'grad' (even though it really is a grad-grad).
#
# You can also add forward derivative definition by defining a formula for
# a returned value (in general "result" if the name is not specified). This
# formula works the same way as the backward one and advanced implementations
# should also be placed in the FunctionsManual file.
# This formula should compute a single Jacobian vector product using the (primal)
# value of the argument "foo_p", its forward grad "foo_t" and the result of the
# function as "result".
# Note that the forward derivative can be automatically generated in two cases:
#     - if your function is linear (NOT affine or multi-linear), then you can
#       specify so by just using the string "auto_linear" for the formula.
#     - if your function is applied element wise (and has a single input), you
#       can specify so by just using the string "auto_element_wise" for the formula.
#
# Note that to avoid unpacking overhead, functions taking TensorList as inputs
# will always have their forward grad formula called. This function is responsible
# to check if any computation is needed and should return an undefined Tensor when
# there is nothing to do. You can check "cat_forward" for a full example.
#
# NB: There are a number of gradient definitions in here which are bogus
# (implemented using zeros_like).  These gradients are (hopefully) not
# used by our frontend.  You MUST check the frontend code; search for
# OpName.apply to see if it's still using a legacy Python style API.
#
# Note: Returning views.
# The following cases exist:
#     - If a function returns no view, it can have arbitrary outputs.
#     - If a function return at least one Tensor that is a differentiable view
#       of one of its input:
#         - If there is only one differentiable output, this Tensor is marked as a
#           differentiable view. (alias or transpose for example)
#         - If there are more than one differentiable output, by default all the views are
#           marked as differentiable views and created with allow_rebase_history=false.
#           Meaning that any inplace operation on it will raise an error. (unbind for example)
#
#  Notes about undefined output gradients:
#     All backward functions must support all combinations of undefined output
#     gradient Tensors, where `grad[i].defined() == false`. Depending on the
#     number of input and output grads your derivative formula uses, code
#     generation may automatically add some level of undefined grad support,
#     according to these three cases:
#
#       * 1 input grad and 1 output grad:
#           Complete undefined grad support is automatically added, so you
#           shouldn't have to think about it, unless there is a bug in the code
#           generation.
#
#       * 1 input grad and multiple output grads:
#           Undefined grad support is automatically added ONLY in the case where
#           all output grads are undefined. You will have to add explicit support
#           for cases where a subset of output grads is undefined.
#
#       * multiple input grads:
#           No automatic support, so you will need to add it.
#
#     If your derivative formula uses more than one output grad, it is usually
#     preferable to add undefined grad support in the backward function itself
#     (if you're using one), rather than in the derivative formula in this file.
#
#     Undefined Tensors are created with the default constructor `at::Tensor()`.
#     It is an efficient way to represent a Tensor filled with zeros because
#     the Tensor holds no sizing information and no Storage data is allocated.
#     But consequentially, Tensor operations cannot be performed on them.
#     Therefore, your backward function should treat an undefined output grad as
#     a zero, and it needs to be a special case.
#
#     If all output grads are undefined, then it should be correct for the
#     backward function to return undefined input grads. Since we use the chain
#     rule, output grads equal to zero should result in input grads equal to zero,
#     unless there is some rare special case.
#
#     If a subset of output grads is undefined, then it may be acceptable for
#     the backward function to return undefined input grads--it depends on the
#     specific function, so you'll have to determine that yourself. If returning
#     an undefined Tensor is correct for a given input grad, it is also logically
#     correct to return a defined grad full of zeros, but that would not be
#     preferable since it would be less efficient.
#
# NB: The parameter names here MUST be consistent with the parameter names
# in native_functions.yaml
