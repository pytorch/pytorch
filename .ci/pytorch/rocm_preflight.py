"""Fast ROCm/RCCL pre-flight health check for distributed CI shards.

Some gfx950 runner pods come up with a container that cannot read part of the
KFD/HSA topology -- RCCL fails every collective init with
"ncclUnhandledCudaError: Call to CUDA function failed / Could not read node #N"
(N is a fixed topology-node index for that pod). When a distributed shard lands
on such a pod, the first collective crashes and a later test hangs the whole
shard until the 270-minute job timeout. Host-side ``rocminfo`` still enumerates
the GPUs on these pods, so the existing GPU-count gate does not catch it.

This runs a tiny multi-rank all_reduce inside the test container before the
suite. If it fails (or is killed by the outer ``timeout``), the job fails in
seconds with a clear message instead of hanging, and the bad pod can be drained.
