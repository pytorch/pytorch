.. versionadded:: 3.18

It is not allowed to create an ``ALIAS`` target with the same name as an
another target.

In CMake 3.17 and below, an ``ALIAS`` target can overwrite silently an existing
target with the same name.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow target overwrite.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to prevent target overwriting.
