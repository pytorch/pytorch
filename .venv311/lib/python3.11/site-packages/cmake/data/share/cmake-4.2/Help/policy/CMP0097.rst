.. versionadded:: 3.16

:command:`ExternalProject_Add` with ``GIT_SUBMODULES ""`` initializes no
submodules.

The commands provide a ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option which controls what submodules
to initialize and update. Starting with CMake 3.16, explicitly setting
``GIT_SUBMODULES`` to an empty string means no submodules will be initialized
or updated.

This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update all git submodules.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update no git submodules.

.. note::

  This policy also applies to :command:`FetchContent_Declare`,
  which uses the same download and update features as
  :command:`ExternalProject_Add`.  However, due to an implementation deficiency
  present since the policy was first introduced, CMake 3.16 and later always
  uses the ``NEW`` behavior for :command:`FetchContent_Declare`, regardless of
  the policy setting. Formally, this forcing of ``NEW`` behavior for
  :command:`FetchContent_Declare` will continue to apply in future CMake
  releases.
