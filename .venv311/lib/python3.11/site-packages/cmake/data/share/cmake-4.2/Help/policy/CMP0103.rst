.. versionadded:: 3.18

Multiple calls to :command:`export` command with same ``FILE`` without
``APPEND`` is no longer allowed.

In CMake 3.17 and below, multiple calls to :command:`export` command with the
same ``FILE`` without ``APPEND`` are accepted silently but only the last
occurrence is taken into account during the generation.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the multiple occurrences of
 :command:`export` command except the last one.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to raise an error on second call to
:command:`export` command with same ``FILE`` without ``APPEND``.
