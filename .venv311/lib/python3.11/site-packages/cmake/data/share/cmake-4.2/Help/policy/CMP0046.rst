Error on non-existent dependency in add_dependencies.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored non-existent dependencies
listed in the :command:`add_dependencies` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently ignore non-existent
dependencies. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error
if non-existent dependencies are listed in the :command:`add_dependencies`
command.
