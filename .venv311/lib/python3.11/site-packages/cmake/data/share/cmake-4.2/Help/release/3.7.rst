Changes made since CMake 3.6 include the following.

New Features
============

Platforms
---------

* CMake now supports :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android` with simple
  toolchain files.

* The Clang compiler is now supported on AIX.

Generators
----------

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator learned to conditionally support
  Fortran when using a ``ninja`` tool that has the necessary features.
  See generator documentation for details.

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator learned to produce phony targets
  of the form ``sub/dir/{test,install,package}`` to drive the build
  of a subdirectory installation, test or packaging target.
  This is equivalent to ``cd sub/dir; make {test,install,package}``
  with :ref:`Makefile Generators`.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 15 2017` generator was added.  This is
  experimental and based on "Visual Studio 2017 RC" because this version
  of VS has not been released.

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above learned to
  place ``.natvis`` source files into VS project files properly.

* The :generator:`Xcode` generator's rudimentary Swift language support
  learned to honor a new :variable:`CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION` variable
  to tell Xcode what version of Swift is used by the source.

* The :generator:`CodeLite` generator gained a new
  :variable:`CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS` option
  to change project creation from projects to targets.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_custom_command` command gained a new ``DEPFILE``
  option that works with the :generator:`Ninja` generator to provide
  implicit dependency information to the build tool.

* The :command:`cmake_parse_arguments` command gained a new ``PARSE_ARGV``
  mode to read arguments directly from ``ARGC`` and ``ARGV#``
  variables inside a :command:`function` body.

* The :command:`export` command gained an ``ANDROID_MK`` option
  to generate ``Android.mk`` files referencing CMake-built
  libraries as prebuilts for the Android NDK build system.

* The :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and :command:`file(UPLOAD)` commands gained
  ``HTTPHEADER <HTTP-header>`` and ``USERPWD <username>:<password>`` options.

* The :command:`find_library` and :command:`find_package` commands learned
  to search in ``lib32/`` directories when the build targets a 32-bit
  architecture.  See the :prop_gbl:`FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS` global
  property.

* The :command:`find_package` command gained the possibility of
  sorting compatible libraries by ``NAME`` or by ``NATURAL`` sorting by
  setting the two new variables :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`
  and :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION`.

* The :command:`if` command gained new boolean comparison operations
  ``LESS_EQUAL``, ``GREATER_EQUAL``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, ``STRGREATER_EQUAL``,
  ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, and ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``.

* The :command:`install` command gained an ``EXPORT_ANDROID_MK``
  subcommand to install ``Android.mk`` files referencing installed
  libraries as prebuilts for the Android NDK build system.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` and :command:`file(TIMESTAMP)`
  commands gained support for the ``%a`` and ``%b`` placeholders.
  These are the abbreviated weekday and month names.

* The :command:`try_compile` command source file signature now honors
  configuration-specific flags (e.g. :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`)
  in the generated test project.  Previously only the default such flags
  for the current toolchain were used.  See policy :policy:`CMP0066`.

Variables
---------

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER` was added to control
  the sorting mode of the :command:`find_package` command.

* Variable :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION` was added to control
  the sorting direction the :command:`find_package` command.

* :variable:`Toolchain files <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may now set a
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT` variable to initialize the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` cache entry the first time a language is
  enabled in a build tree.

* :variable:`Toolchain files <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>` may now set
  :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`, and
  :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT` variables to initialize the
  :variable:`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS`, and
  :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS` cache entries the first time
  a language is enabled in a build tree.

Properties
----------

* On Apple platforms the :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE_EXTENSION` target property
  now also applies to Frameworks and App Bundles.

* A :prop_dir:`BINARY_DIR` directory property was added to get the
  absolute path to the binary directory corresponding to the source
  directory on which the property is read.

* A :prop_dir:`BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS` directory property was added to
  get the list of logical buildsystem target names added by the
  project in a directory.

* A :prop_tgt:`LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable were introduced
  to detect (on UNIX) shared libraries that are linked but not
  needed by running ``ldd -r -u``.

* A :prop_dir:`SOURCE_DIR` directory property was added to get the
  absolute path to the source directory associated with a directory.

* A :prop_dir:`SUBDIRECTORIES` directory property was added to
  get the list of subdirectories added by a project in a directory.

* A :prop_tgt:`VS_SDK_REFERENCES` target property was added to tell
  :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` to reference the named SDKs.

* A :prop_sf:`VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE` source file property was created to tell
  :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` what tool to use for a source file.

* The :prop_tgt:`WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` target property now applies
  to executable targets with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property set.

* A :prop_sf:`XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES` source file property was
  added to tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator to generate
  custom content in the Xcode project attributes for the file.

  :prop_test:`FIXTURES_CLEANUP` and :prop_test:`FIXTURES_REQUIRED` test
  properties. When using regular expressions or ``--rerun-failed`` to limit
  the tests to be run, a fixture's setup and cleanup tests will automatically
  be added to the execution set if any test requires that fixture.

* The :command:`ctest_configure`, :command:`ctest_build`,
  :command:`ctest_test`, :command:`ctest_coverage`, and :command:`ctest_upload`

  ``USER_INTERFACES`` option to add a list of additional pages to the IFW
  installer.

  of a custom absolute installation prefix outside
  of the ProgramFiles folders.

  :variable:`CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION` to allow the specification
  of a custom title and description for the root feature element.

Other
-----

* :manual:`cmake(1)` gained a ``-E capabilities`` option to provide a
  machine-readable (JSON) description of the capabilities of the
  cmake tool (available generators, etc.).

* A new :manual:`cmake-server(7)` mode was added to provide semantic
  information about a CMake-generated buildsystem to clients through
  a JSON protocol.  Currently all protocols are experimental and subject
  to change.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` command learned a ``--trace-source=<file>`` option.

* :manual:`ccmake(1)` learned to support vim-like navigation bindings.

* :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` gained a button to open the generated project file
  for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and the :generator:`Xcode` generator.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* We no longer provide Linux i386 binaries for download from ``cmake.org``
  for new versions of CMake.

* Vim support files ``cmake-indent.vim``, ``cmake-syntax.vim``, and
  ``cmake-help.vim`` have been removed in favor of the files now provided
  from the `vim-cmake-syntax`_ project.

* Support for building CMake itself with some compilers was dropped:

  * Visual Studio 7.1 and 2005 -- superseded by VS 2008 and above
  * MinGW.org mingw32 -- superseded by MSYS2 mingw32 and mingw64

  CMake still supports generating build systems for other projects using
  these compilers.

Other Changes
=============

* The Fortran dependency scanner learned to support the syntax of
  `Fortran Submodules`_.

* Vim support files ``indent/cmake.vim`` and ``syntax/cmake.vim``
  from the `vim-cmake-syntax`_ project are now distributed with CMake.
