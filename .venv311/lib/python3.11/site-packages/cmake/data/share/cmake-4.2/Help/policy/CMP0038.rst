Targets may not link directly to themselves.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a build target to link to itself directly with
a :command:`target_link_libraries` call. This is an indicator of a bug in
user code.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore targets which list themselves
in their own link implementation.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
report an error if a target attempts to link to itself.
