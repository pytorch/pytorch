Case sensitive ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` generator expressions

CMake 2.8.12 introduced the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID``
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` to allow
comparison of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` with a test value.  The
possible valid values are lowercase, but the comparison with the test value
was performed case-insensitively.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to perform a case-insensitive comparison
with the value in the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` expression. The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to perform a case-sensitive comparison with the value in
the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` expression.
