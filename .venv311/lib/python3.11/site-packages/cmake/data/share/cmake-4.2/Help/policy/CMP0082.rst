.. versionadded:: 3.14

Install rules from :command:`add_subdirectory` calls are interleaved with
those in caller.

CMake 3.13 and lower ran the install rules from :command:`add_subdirectory`
after all other install rules, even if :command:`add_subdirectory` was called
before the other install rules.  CMake 3.14 and above prefer to interleave
these :command:`add_subdirectory` install rules with the others so that
they are run in the order they are declared.  This policy provides
compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the
new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to run the install rules from
:command:`add_subdirectory` after the other install rules.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to run all install rules in the order they are
declared.
