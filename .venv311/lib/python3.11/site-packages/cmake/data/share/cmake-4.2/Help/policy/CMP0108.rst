.. versionadded:: 3.18

A target is not allowed to link to itself even through an ``ALIAS`` target.

In CMake 3.17 and below, a target can link to a target aliased to itself.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow a target to link to a target
aliased to itself.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to prevent a target to link to itself
through an ``ALIAS`` target.
