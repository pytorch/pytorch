.. versionadded:: 3.14

:command:`install(CODE)` and :command:`install(SCRIPT)` support generator
expressions.

In CMake 3.13 and earlier, :command:`install(CODE)` and
:command:`install(SCRIPT)` did not evaluate generator expressions.  CMake 3.14
and later will evaluate generator expressions for :command:`install(CODE)` and
:command:`install(SCRIPT)`.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :command:`install(CODE)` and
:command:`install(SCRIPT)` to not evaluate generator expressions.  The ``NEW``
behavior is to evaluate generator expressions for :command:`install(CODE)` and
:command:`install(SCRIPT)`.

Note that it is the value of this policy setting at the end of the directory
scope that is important, not its setting at the time of the call to
:command:`install(CODE)` or :command:`install(SCRIPT)`.  This has implications
for calling these commands from places that have their own policy scope but not
their own directory scope (e.g. from files brought in via :command:`include()`
rather than :command:`add_subdirectory()`).
