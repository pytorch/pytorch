-------

.. versionadded:: 4.1

The :module:`FindGCCXML` module is removed.

CMake 4.0 and below provide the :module:`FindGCCXML` module, but the GCC-XML
tool has long been superseded by CastXML.  CMake 4.1 and above prefer to not
provide the :module:`FindGCCXML` module.  This policy provides compatibility
for projects that have not been ported away from it.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(GCCXML)`` to load
the deprecated module.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for ``find_package(GCCXML)``
to fail as if the module does not exist.
