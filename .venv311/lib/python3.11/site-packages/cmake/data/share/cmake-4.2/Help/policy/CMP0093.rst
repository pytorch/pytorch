.. versionadded:: 3.15

:module:`FindBoost` reports ``Boost_VERSION`` in ``x.y.z`` format.

In CMake 3.14 and below the module would report the Boost version
number as specified in the preprocessor definition ``BOOST_VERSION`` in
the ``boost/version.hpp`` file. In CMake 3.15 and later it is preferred
that the reported version number matches the ``x.y.z`` format reported
by the CMake package shipped with Boost ``1.70.0`` and later. The macro
value is still reported in the ``Boost_VERSION_MACRO`` variable.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for :module:`FindBoost` to report
``Boost_VERSION`` as specified in the preprocessor definition
``BOOST_VERSION`` in ``boost/version.hpp``. The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is for :module:`FindBoost` to report ``Boost_VERSION`` in
``x.y.z`` format.
