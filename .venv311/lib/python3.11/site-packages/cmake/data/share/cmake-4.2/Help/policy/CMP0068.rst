.. versionadded:: 3.9

``RPATH`` settings on macOS do not affect ``install_name``.

CMake 3.9 and newer remove any effect the following settings may have on the
``install_name`` of a target on macOS:

* :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` target property
* :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH` target property
* :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` variable
* :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` variable

Previously, setting :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` had the effect of
setting both the ``install_name`` of a target to :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`
and the ``RPATH`` to :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  In CMake 3.9, it only affects
setting of ``RPATH``.  However, if one wants :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` to
apply to the target in the build tree, one may set
:prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.

If :prop_tgt:`SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`, :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH` or
:variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH` were used to strip the directory portion
of the ``install_name`` of a target, one may set ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR=""``
instead.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to use the ``RPATH`` settings for
``install_name`` on macOS.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to ignore
the ``RPATH`` settings for ``install_name`` on macOS.
