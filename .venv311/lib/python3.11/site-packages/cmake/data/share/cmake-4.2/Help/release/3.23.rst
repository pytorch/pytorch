Changes made since CMake 3.22 include the following.

New Features
============

Presets
-------

* :manual:`cmake-presets(7)` files now support schema version ``4``.

* :manual:`cmake-presets(7)` files now have an optional ``include`` field,
  which allows the files to include other files.

* :manual:`cmake-presets(7)` files now support a ``${fileDir}`` macro, which
  contains the directory containing the preset file.

* :manual:`cmake-presets(7)` gained support for specifying the
  ``resolvePackageReferences`` command line option in a build preset to control
  restoration behavior of package references from external package managers.
  Currently this is only supported by the Visual Studio generator to support
  restoring packages from NuGet. Other generators ignore this option.

Generators
----------

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2019 and above learned to
  support .NET SDK-style project files (``.csproj``) for C# projects.
  See the :prop_tgt:`DOTNET_SDK` target property and corresponding
  :variable:`CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK` variable.  :command:`add_custom_command`
  is not yet supported in .NET SDK-style projects.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and above learned to
  use portable instances of Visual Studio not known to the VS installer.
  See the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` variable.

Command-Line
------------

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` :option:`--build <cmake --build>` command, when used with
  :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` on projects that set the
  :prop_tgt:`VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES` target property, now automatically
  restores package references from NuGet.  The cache variable
  :variable:`CMAKE_VS_NUGET_PACKAGE_RESTORE` may be set to toggle this behavior
  in a build tree.  Use the
  :option:`--resolve-package-references <cmake--build --resolve-package-references>`
  command-line option to control the behavior on one invocation.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` command line tool gained a
  :option:`--debug-find-pkg <cmake --debug-find-pkg>`
  option to enable debug messages under specific :command:`find_package`
  calls.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` command line tool gained a
  :option:`--debug-find-var <cmake --debug-find-var>`
  option to enable debug messages for ``find_*`` calls that use specific
  result variables.

Compilers
---------

* The IBM Open XL C/C++ compiler, based on LLVM, is now supported with
  compiler id ``IBMClang``.

* The MCST LCC compiler is now supported with compiler id ``LCC``.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0129`.

File-Based API
--------------

* The :manual:`cmake-file-api(7)` "codemodel" version 2 ``version`` field
  has been updated to ``2.4``.

* The :manual:`cmake-file-api(7)` "codemodel" version 2 ``directory``
  object ``installers`` field gained a new ``fileSet`` installer type
  and associated ``fileSetName``, ``fileSetType``, ``fileSetDirectories``,
  and ``fileSetTarget`` fields.

Commands
--------

* The :command:`define_property` command gained a new
  ``INITIALIZE_FROM_VARIABLE`` option to cause a target property to be
  initialized from a variable when a target is created.

* The :command:`install(TARGETS)` command gained a new ``FILE_SET`` argument,
  which can be used to install header file sets associated with a target.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` and :command:`file(TIMESTAMP)` commands now
  support the ``%f`` specifier for microseconds.

* The :command:`target_sources` command gained a new ``FILE_SET`` mode, which
  can be used to add headers as header-only source files of a target.

Variables
---------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` variable and associated
  :prop_tgt:`CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` target property now support the
  ``all``, and ``all-major`` values for CUDA toolkit 7.0+.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH` variables were added
  to tell the :command:`find_package`, :command:`find_program`,
  :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
  commands to ignore specified prefixes.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS` variable and
  corresponding :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS` target
  property were added to optionally require that all link items
  that can be target names are actually names of existing targets.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_tgt:`HEADER_SETS` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` read-only
  target properties were added to list header sets associated with a target.

* The :prop_tgt:`HEADER_SET` and :prop_tgt:`HEADER_SET_<NAME>` target
  properties were added to list files in the default header set
  and named header sets, respectively.

* The :prop_tgt:`HEADER_DIRS` and :prop_tgt:`HEADER_DIRS_<NAME>` target
  properties were added to specify the base directories of the default
  header set and named header sets, respectively.

* The :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_NO_SYSTEM` target property was added to
  specify that an :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` should
  not be treated as a system library (i.e. its include directories
  are not automatically ``SYSTEM``).

* The :prop_tgt:`XCODE_EMBED_PLUGINS <XCODE_EMBED_<type>>` target property
  was added to tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator what targets to put in
  the ``Embed PlugIns`` build phase.

* The :prop_tgt:`XCODE_SCHEME_ENABLE_GPU_FRAME_CAPTURE_MODE` target property
  and supporting :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_SCHEME_ENABLE_GPU_FRAME_CAPTURE_MODE`
  variable were added to tell the :generator:`Xcode` generator to enable
  specifying the Xcode scheme option property ``GPU Frame Capture``.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckPIESupported` module now supports the ``OBJC``,
  ``OBJCXX``, ``CUDA``, and ``HIP`` languages.  It also now honors
  :variable:`CMAKE_SYSROOT` and :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module's :command:`ExternalProject_Add`
  command gained support for a ``USES_TERMINAL_PATCH`` option to give
  the patch step exclusive terminal access.

* The :module:`FindCUDAToolkit` module now provides a target for
  ``libcufft_static_nocallback``, if found.

* The :module:`FindGLUT` module now provides the ``GLUT_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  result variable to conform with naming conventions documented in the
  :manual:`cmake-developer(7)` manual.  This supersedes the legacy
  ``GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR`` variable.

* The :module:`FindGTest` module now provides a target for GMock, if found.

* The :module:`FindVulkan` module now provides a ``Vulkan_VERSION`` result
  variable reporting the version number.

CTest
-----

* :manual:`ctest(1)` gained a new :variable:`CTEST_SUBMIT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`
  variable, which can be used to specify a timeout for submission inactivity.

CPack
-----

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator` gained the new
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`,
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_ANYWHERE`,
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_USER`, and
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS_ROOT` variables for
  adding the domains element to the Distribution XML. With these variables,
  it is now possible to install products to the user's home directory
  without requiring administrative privileges.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator` gained a new variable,
  :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_IDENTIFIER`, used to customize the unique
  product identifier associated with the product.

* The ``CPack.distribution.dist.in`` template used by the
  :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator` and
  CPack ``PackageMaker`` generator was updated to use a new
  ``CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT`` variable for its main content.
  This replaced the previously undocumented and now deprecated
  ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` variable.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` gained the new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_ARCHIVE_FORMAT` and
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_ARCHIVE_COMPRESSION` variables for setting the
  format used when packaging new component data archives, and choosing
  the compression level used.
  These features are available for QtIFW 4.2 and newer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` gained new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_DISABLE_COMMAND_LINE_INTERFACE` variable to
  prevent the user from passing any consumer command to the installer, like
  ``install``, ``update``, and ``remove``.
  This feature is available for QtIFW 4.0 and newer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` gained the new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_PRODUCT_IMAGES` variable for adding a
  list of images to be shown on the ``PerformInstallationPage``.
  This feature is available for QtIFW 4.0 and newer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` gained the new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_RUN_PROGRAM`,
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_RUN_PROGRAM_ARGUMENTS`, and
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_RUN_PROGRAM_DESCRIPTION` variables for
  executing a command after the installer is done if the user accepts
  the action.  This feature is available for QtIFW 4.0 and newer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` gained the new
  :variable:`CPACK_IFW_PACKAGE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` variable for specifying a
  code signing identity to be used for signing the generated app bundle.
  This feature is available on macOS only, and for QtIFW 3.0 and newer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator` gained a new variable,
  :variable:`CPACK_WIX_SKIP_WIX_UI_EXTENSION`, to skip the inclusion
  of WixUIExtensions.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* :manual:`cmake(1)` now warns when multiple source paths are specified,
  as in ``cmake -S src1 src2``.  This has never been officially documented
  or supported, but older versions accidentally accepted multiple source
  paths and used the last path specified.  Update scripts to avoid
  passing multiple source path arguments.

* The :manual:`cpack(1)` undocumented ``OSXX11`` generator has been removed.

* The previously undocumented ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` variable used in
  the ``CPack.distribution.dist.in`` template has been replaced by a new
  ``CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT`` variable. This only affects projects
  that were providing their own custom ``CPack.distribution.dist.in`` template
  file, but still relied on ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` being set. Those
  custom template files should be updated to use
  ``CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT`` instead, or to fully define all the
  template file's contents without relying on substitution of either variable.

Other Changes
=============

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack DragNDrop Generator` no longer attaches
  :variable:`CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` as the license agreement in
  the generated ``.dmg`` unless explicitly activated by a
  :variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` option.
  In CMake projects, the :module:`CPack` module enables the option
  by default for compatibility.

* ``CUDA`` targets may now enable both :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION`
  and :prop_tgt:`CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION`.

* ``CUDA`` compiler detection now:

  * issues an error in all cases when it's unable to compute the default
    architecture(s) if required (see :policy:`CMP0104`),

  * handles ``OFF`` for :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` on Clang,

  * supports the theoretical case of multiple default architectures, and

  * tries to detect invalid architectures and issue an error.

* ``CUDA`` with Clang now implements policy :policy:`CMP0105` and
  the :genex:`$<DEVICE_LINK:...>` and :genex:`$<HOST_LINK:...>`
  generator expressions.

* The :command:`define_property` command's ``BRIEF_DOCS`` and ``FULL_DOCS``
  arguments are now optional.

* :manual:`ccmake(1)` may now be enabled on Windows when building
  CMake from source.  This is experimental, and so is not included
  in official distributions.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.23.0 include the following.

3.23.1
------

* The :command:`target_sources` ``FILE_SET`` feature added in CMake 3.23.0
  does not yet place header files properly in Apple :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`
  targets.  Pending further work in a future version of CMake, it is now
  an error to add a ``FILE_SET`` of type ``HEADERS`` to such targets on
  Apple platforms.

* The :prop_tgt:`HEADER_SETS` and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` target
  properties added in CMake 3.23.0 are now read-only records of the header
  sets created by the :command:`target_sources` command.

3.23.2
------

* The ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` variable used in the
  ``CPack.distribution.dist.in`` template file was replaced by a new
  ``CPACK_APPLE_PKG_INSTALLER_CONTENT`` variable in CMake 3.23.0.
  This broke projects that provided their own template file but still
  expected the ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` variable to be defined.
  The old ``CPACK_PACKAGEMAKER_CHOICES`` variable is now also set to the
  same content as it was before, but it is formally deprecated.

3.23.3, 3.23.4, 3.23.5
----------------------

* These versions made no changes to documented features or interfaces.
  Some implementation updates were made to support ecosystem changes
  and/or fix regressions.
