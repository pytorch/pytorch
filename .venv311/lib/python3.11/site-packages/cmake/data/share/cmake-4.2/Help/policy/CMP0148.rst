.. versionadded:: 3.27

The :module:`FindPythonInterp` and :module:`FindPythonLibs` modules are removed.

These modules have been deprecated since CMake 3.12.
CMake 3.27 and above prefer to not provide the modules.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been
ported away from them.

Projects using the :module:`FindPythonInterp` and/or :module:`FindPythonLibs`
modules should be updated to use one of their replacements:

* :module:`FindPython3`
* :module:`FindPython2`
* :module:`FindPython`

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(PythonInterp)``
and ``find_package(PythonLibs)`` to load the deprecated modules.  The ``NEW``
behavior is for uses of the modules to fail as if they do not exist.
