The :command:`project` command manages ``VERSION`` variables.

CMake version 3.0 introduced the ``VERSION`` option of the :command:`project`
command to specify a project version as well as the name.  In order to keep
:variable:`PROJECT_VERSION` and related variables consistent with variable
:variable:`PROJECT_NAME` it is necessary to set the ``VERSION`` variables
to the empty string when no ``VERSION`` is given to :command:`project`.
However, this can change behavior for existing projects that set ``VERSION``
variables themselves since :command:`project` may now clear them.
This policy controls the behavior for compatibility with such projects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave ``VERSION`` variables untouched.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set ``VERSION`` as documented by the
:command:`project` command.
