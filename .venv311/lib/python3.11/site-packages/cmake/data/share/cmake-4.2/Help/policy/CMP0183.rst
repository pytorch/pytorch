CMP0183
-------

.. versionadded:: 4.0

:command:`add_feature_info` supports full :ref:`Condition Syntax`.

The ``<condition>`` parameter accepts a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake
Language Lists>` of conditions.  CMake 3.31 and lower evaluate each
``condition`` as ``if(${condition})``, which does not properly handle
conditions with nested paren groups.  CMake 4.0 and above instead prefer
to evaluate each ``condition`` as ``if(<condition>)``, where ``<condition>``
is re-parsed as if literally written in a call to :command:`if`.  This
allows expressions like::

  "A AND (B OR C)"

but requires expressions like::

  "FOO MATCHES (UPPER|lower)"

to be re-written as::

  "FOO MATCHES \"(UPPER|lower)\""

Policy ``CMP0183`` provides compatibility for projects that have not
been updated to expect the new behavior.
