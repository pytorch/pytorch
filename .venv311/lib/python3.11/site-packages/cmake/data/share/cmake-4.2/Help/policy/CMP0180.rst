.. versionadded:: 3.31

:command:`project` always sets ``<PROJECT-NAME>_*`` as normal variables.

In CMake 3.29 and below, the :command:`project` command set
:variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR`, :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR`,
and :variable:`<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL` as cache entries, but not as
normal variables.  CMake 3.30 started setting them as normal variables,
but only if they are already set as normal variables.  This was needed to
preserve support for some :module:`FetchContent` use cases under policy
:policy:`CMP0169`'s NEW behavior, while also preserving behavior of nested
directories that call :command:`project` with the same project name.
See release notes for 3.30.3, 3.30.4, and 3.30.5 for details.

CMake 3.31 and later prefer to always set ``<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR``,
``<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR``, and ``<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL``, as both
cache entries and normal variables, regardless of what cache or normal
variables already exist.  This policy provides compatibility for projects
that have not been updated to expect this behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy will only set normal variables for
``<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR``, ``<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR``, and
``<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL`` if there is already a normal variable by that
name when :command:`project` is called.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy will always set normal variables for
``<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR``, ``<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR``, and
``<PROJECT-NAME>_IS_TOP_LEVEL`` when :command:`project` is called.
