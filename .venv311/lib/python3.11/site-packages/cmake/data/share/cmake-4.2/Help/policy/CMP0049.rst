Do not expand variables in target source entries.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower performed an extra layer of variable expansion
when evaluating source file names::

  set(a_source foo.c)
  add_executable(foo \${a_source})

.. note: no cmake highlighting since this syntax is deprecated

This was undocumented behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to expand such variables when processing
the target sources.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue an error
if such variables need to be expanded.
