.. versionadded:: 3.17

Link properties are transitive over private dependencies of static libraries.

In CMake 3.16 and below, evaluation of target properties
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`, :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES`,
and :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS` during buildsystem generation does not
follow private dependencies of static libraries, which appear in their
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` guarded by :genex:`LINK_ONLY` generator
expressions.
Only the libraries themselves are propagated to link the dependent binary.

CMake 3.17 and later prefer to propagate all interface link properties.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not propagate interface link
properties. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to propagate interface link
properties.

.. versionadded:: 3.30

  Policy :policy:`CMP0166` makes :genex:`TARGET_PROPERTY` evaluation of
  these three transitive link properties follow private dependencies of
  static libraries too.
