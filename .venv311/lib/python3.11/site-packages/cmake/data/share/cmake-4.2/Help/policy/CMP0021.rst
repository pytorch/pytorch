Fatal error on relative paths in :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target
property.

CMake 2.8.10.2 and lower allowed the :prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target
property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative
entries is not well defined.  CMake 2.8.12 issues a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if the
:prop_tgt:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property contains a relative path.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is not to warn about relative paths
in the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` contains a
relative path.
