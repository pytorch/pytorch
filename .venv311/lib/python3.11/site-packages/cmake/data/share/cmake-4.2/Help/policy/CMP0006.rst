Installing :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` targets requires a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION``.

This policy determines whether the :command:`install(TARGETS)` command must be
given a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` when asked to install a target with the
:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish
application bundles from normal executables when installing targets.
CMake 2.6 provides a ``BUNDLE`` option to the :command:`install(TARGETS)`
command that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac.
Projects should use this option when installing a target with the
:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to fall back to the
``RUNTIME DESTINATION`` if a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` is not given.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed
without a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION``.
