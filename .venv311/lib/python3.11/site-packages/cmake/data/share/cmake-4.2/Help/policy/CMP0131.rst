.. versionadded:: 3.24

:prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES` supports the :genex:`$<LINK_ONLY:...>`
generator expression.

CMake 3.23 and below documented the :genex:`$<LINK_ONLY:...>` generator
expression only for use in :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`.
When used in :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES`, the content guarded inside
:genex:`$<LINK_ONLY:...>` was always used, even when collecting non-linking
usage requirements such as :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`.

CMake 3.24 and above prefer to support :genex:`$<LINK_ONLY:...>`, when
used in :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES`, by using the guarded content only
for link dependencies and not other usage requirements.  This policy
provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to
account for this change.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use :prop_tgt:`LINK_LIBRARIES`
content guarded by :genex:`$<LINK_ONLY:...>` even for non-linking
usage requirements.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use
the guarded content only for link dependencies.
