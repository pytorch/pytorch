.. versionadded:: 3.31

The :module:`CMakeFindFrameworks` module is removed.

CMake's framework handling has evolved well beyond what the
``CMakeFindFrameworks`` module supports. The module lacks any handling of
XCFrameworks, it never documented the one command it provides, and
:command:`find_library` provides superior capabilities in all respects.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :module:`CMakeFindFrameworks` to
continue to provide the undocumented ``cmake_find_frameworks()`` command.
The ``NEW`` behavior halts with a fatal error if anything tries to include
the module.
