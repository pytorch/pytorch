.. versionadded:: 3.30

The :module:`FindBoost` module is removed.

CMake 3.29 and below provide a ``FindBoost`` module, but it needs constant
updates to keep up with upstream Boost releases.  Upstream Boost 1.70
and above provide a ``BoostConfig.cmake`` package configuration file.
``find_package(Boost CONFIG)`` finds the upstream package directly,
without the find module.

CMake 3.30 and above prefer to not provide the ``FindBoost`` module
so that ``find_package(Boost)`` calls, without the ``CONFIG`` or
``NO_MODULE`` options, find the upstream ``BoostConfig.cmake`` directly.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been ported
to use the upstream Boost package.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(Boost)`` to
load CMake's :module:`FindBoost` module.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for
``find_package(Boost)`` to search for the upstream ``BoostConfig.cmake``.
