The :command:`output_required_files` command should not be called.

This command was added in June 2001 to expose the then-current CMake
implicit dependency scanner.  CMake's real implicit dependency scanner
has evolved since then but is not exposed through this command.  The
scanning capabilities of this command are very limited and this
functionality is better achieved through dedicated outside tools.
