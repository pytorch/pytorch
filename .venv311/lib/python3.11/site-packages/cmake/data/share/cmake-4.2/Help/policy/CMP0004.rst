Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.

CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing
whitespace from libraries linked with code like

.. code-block:: cmake

  target_link_libraries(myexe " A ")

This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and
trailing whitespace.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to diagnose
the existence of such whitespace as an error.  The setting for this
policy used when checking the library names is that in effect when the
target is created by an :command:`add_executable` or :command:`add_library`
command.
