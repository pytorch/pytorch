Utility targets may not have link dependencies.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed using utility targets in the left hand side
position of the :command:`target_link_libraries` command. This is an indicator
of a bug in user code.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore attempts to set the link
libraries of utility targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
report an error if an attempt is made to set the link libraries of a
utility target.
