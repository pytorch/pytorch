Compiler id for Apple Clang is now ``AppleClang``.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that Apple Clang is a different compiler
than upstream Clang and that they have different version numbers.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``AppleClang`` instead
of ``Clang``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
Apple Clang is just ``Clang`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for Apple Clang which compiler id to
report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or
:command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``Clang``.  The
``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``AppleClang``.
