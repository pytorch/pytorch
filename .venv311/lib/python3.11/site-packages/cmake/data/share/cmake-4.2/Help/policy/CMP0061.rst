CTest does not by default tell ``make`` to ignore errors (``-i``).

The :command:`ctest_build` and :command:`build_command` commands no
longer generate build commands for :ref:`Makefile Generators` with
the ``-i`` option.  Previously this was done to help build as much
of tested projects as possible.  However, this behavior is not
consistent with other generators and also causes the return code
of the ``make`` tool to be meaningless.

Of course users may still add this option manually by setting
:variable:`CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND` or the ``MAKECOMMAND`` cache entry.
See the :ref:`CTest Build Step` ``MakeCommand`` setting documentation
for their effects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to add ``-i`` to ``make``
calls in CTest.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not
add ``-i``.
