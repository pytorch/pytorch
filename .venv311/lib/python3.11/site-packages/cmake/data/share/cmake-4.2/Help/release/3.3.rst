Changes made since CMake 3.2 include the following.

New Features
============

Generators
----------

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` now add ``.DELETE_ON_ERROR`` to the
  makefiles that contain the actual build rules for files on disk.
  This tells GNU make to remove rule outputs when their recipe
  modifies an output but fails.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned to support ``.xaml``
  source files and automatically associate them with corresponding
  ``.h`` and ``.cpp`` sources.

* A new experimental :generator:`Green Hills MULTI` generator was
  added on Windows.  `Green Hills MULTI`_ is an IDE for embedded
  real-time systems.

.. _`Green Hills MULTI`: https://www.ghs.com/products/MULTI_IDE.html

Commands
--------

* The :command:`add_dependencies` command learned to allow dependencies
  to be added to :ref:`interface libraries <Interface Libraries>`.
  Dependencies added to an interface library are followed transitively
  in its place since the target itself does not build.

* The :command:`execute_process` command learned to support specifying
  the same file for ``OUTPUT_FILE`` and ``ERROR_FILE``.

* The :command:`file(GLOB)` and :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` commands
  learned a new ``LIST_DIRECTORIES <bool>`` option to specify whether
  the glob result should include directories.

* The :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_path`, and :command:`find_file`
  commands now search in installation prefixes derived from the ``PATH``
  environment variable.

* The :command:`if` command learned a new ``IN_LIST`` operator that
  evaluates to true if a given element is contained in a named list.

* The :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:`export()` commands
  learned to export targets that populate the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES`
  target property.

* The :command:`install(TARGETS)` command learned to support
  generator expressions in the ``DESTINATION`` value.

Variables
---------

* The version of some Fortran compilers is now detected and stored in the
  :variable:`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION>`
  variable.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` learned a new
  :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD` option
  to put the ``INSTALL`` target in the default build of a
  solution (``.sln``) file.

Properties
----------

* A :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` variable were introduced
  to allow target platform binaries to run on the host during cross
  compiling.

* A :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property and supporting
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable were introduced
  to tell the :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator
  to run ``include-what-you-use`` along with the compiler for ``C`` and
  ``CXX`` languages.

* The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` and
  :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target properties now
  affect compilation in sources of all target types.  See
  policy :policy:`CMP0063`.

* The :prop_tgt:`XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>` target property learned
  to support generator expressions.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CheckFortranCompilerFlag` module was introduced
  to check ``Fortran`` compiler flags, much like the
  :module:`CheckCCompilerFlag` module already does for ``C``.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new
  :variable:`ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS` option to disable use of
  symbolic links to populate the real data files and use copies
  instead.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new ``RECURSE:``
  option in ``DATA{}`` references specifying directories.
  This allows an entire directory tree of associated files
  to be matched.

* The :module:`ExternalData` module learned a new URL template
  placeholder ``%(algo:<key>)`` to allow custom mapping from
  algorithm name to URL component through configuration of new
  :variable:`ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>` variables.
  This allows more flexibility in remote URLs.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module learned to replace tokens
  like ``<BINARY_DIR>`` in the ``BYPRODUCTS`` of each step.

* The :module:`ExternalProject` module APIs learned to support
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`
  when using ``LOG_*`` options and in CMake initial cache options.

* The :module:`FindBoost` module now tracks the directories containing
  libraries separately for RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.

* The :module:`FindCUDA` module now defaults to using the static
  CUDA runtime library if it is available.  A new
  ``CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME`` option is offered to control
  this behavior.

* The :module:`FindMatlab` module was completely rewritten.  It learned
  about versions and components and to find Matlab in a more precise and
  multiplatform way.  The module now offers APIs to create mex extensions,
  documentation, and unit tests.

* The :module:`FindPackageHandleStandardArgs` module
  :command:`find_package_handle_standard_args` command now
  always populates both the ``<PackageName>_FOUND``
  and ``<UPPERCASE_NAME>_FOUND`` variables (the latter
  for backwards compatibility).  The ``FOUND_VAR``
  option is now ignored except to enforce its allowed
  values.

* The :module:`InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` module learned a new
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT`` option to specify the
  installation component.

Generator Expressions
---------------------

* A new ``COMPILE_LANGUAGE`` generator expression was introduced to
  allow specification of compile options for target files based on the
  :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` of each source file.  Due to limitations of the
  underlying native build tools, this feature has varying support across
  generators.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual
  for details.

CTest
-----

* The :manual:`ctest(1)` tool learned a new ``--repeat-until-fail <n>``
  option to help find sporadic test failures.

* The :module:`CTestCoverageCollectGCOV` module learned to support
  the same ``CTEST_CUSTOM_COVERAGE_EXCLUDE`` option as the
  :command:`ctest_coverage` command.

CPack
-----

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack IFW Generator` learned to support
  Qt Framework Installer 2.0 tools.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack DEB Generator` learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`
  variable to specify per-component use of ``dpkg-shlibdeps``.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack DEB Generator` learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS`
  option to specify per-component dependencies.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack RPM Generator` learned to package symbolic links
  more cleanly and now supports directory symlinks with recent
  ``rpmbuild`` versions.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack RPM Generator` learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_ADDITIONAL_MAN_DIRS` variable to specify
  directories containing man pages for the brp-compress RPM macro.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack RPM Generator` learned a new
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE` variable
  to specify a component-specific package architecture.

* The CPack WIX generator learned the new
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_START_MENU_SHORTCUTS`,
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_DESKTOP_SHORTCUTS` and
  :prop_inst:`CPACK_STARTUP_SHORTCUTS` installed file properties which can
  be used to install shortcuts in the Start Menu, on the Desktop and
  in the Startup Folder respectively.

Other
-----

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  is now aware of features supported by GNU compilers on Windows, versions
  4.4 through 5.0.

* The :manual:`cmake(1)` ``-E tar`` command learned a new
  ``--format<format>`` option to specify the archive format to
  be written.

* On OS X, CMake learned to create XCTest bundles to test Frameworks
  and App Bundles within Xcode.  The :module:`FindXCTest` module
  provides convenience functions to handle :prop_tgt:`XCTEST` bundles.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* On OS X the :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` no longer has the
  ``Install For Command Line Use`` menu item.  Instead there
  is a ``How to Install For Command Line Use`` menu item
  that shows an informational dialog box explaining how to
  make the command line tools available.  For example::

    /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install

* The :command:`ctest_build` and :command:`build_command` commands
  no longer tell ``make`` tools to ignore errors with the ``-i`` option.
  Previously this was done for :ref:`Makefile Generators` but not others.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0061`.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010` generator no longer checks
  for running VS IDEs with the project open or asks them to reload.
  This was originally done for VS 10 because it had been done for
  VS 7 through 9 to avoid prompting for every project in a solution.
  Since VS >= 10 allow the whole solution to reload at once they
  do not need CMake to help them.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 7` generator (.NET 2002) is now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 6` generator is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

* The :command:`find_package` command no longer considers project
  build trees recently configured in a :manual:`cmake-gui(1)`.
  This was previously done only on Windows and is now never done.
  The ``NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH`` option is now ignored if given
  and effectively always on.
  Projects may populate the :ref:`User Package Registry` to aid
  users building multiple dependent projects one after another.

* The :command:`add_definitions()` command no longer causes a
  :prop_dir:`DEFINITIONS` directory property to be populated. See policy
  :policy:`CMP0059`.

* With Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9 generators the value of the ``$(OutDir)``
  placeholder no longer evaluates to the configuration name.  Projects
  should use ``$(ConfigurationName)`` for that instead.

* Using the output of :command:`export()` with the :command:`install(FILES)`
  command is no longer allowed.  See policy :policy:`CMP0062` for details.

Other Changes
=============

* The :generator:`Ninja` generator now requires that calls to the
  :command:`add_custom_command` and :command:`add_custom_target`
  commands use the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to explicitly specify any
  files generated by the custom commands that are not listed as
  outputs (perhaps because their timestamps are allowed to be older
  than the inputs).  See policy :policy:`CMP0058`.

* Build-time progress output of :ref:`Makefile Generators` has been improved.
  It no longer mixes progress and build rule messages during parallel builds.
  The link rule messages now have progress and are displayed as bold green
  instead of bold red (since red is often associated with an error message).

* The :variable:`CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR` variable value for Visual Studio
  7, 8, and 9 is now ``$(ConfigurationName)`` instead of ``$(OutDir)``.
  This should have no effect on the intended use cases of the variable.

* Linking to library files by a full path in an implicit linker search
  directory (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.a``) no longer asks the linker to
  search for the library (e.g. ``-lfoo``) and now links by full path.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0060`.
