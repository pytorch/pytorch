.. versionadded:: 3.27

AUTOMOC include directory is a system include directory by default.

Headers generated for :ref:`Qt AUTOMOC` are placed in target-specific include
directories.  CMake 3.26 and older added these as normal include directories.
CMake 3.27 and newer prefer to add them as system include directories.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect this.

If the :prop_tgt:`AUTOGEN_USE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE` target property is set,
perhaps via the :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOGEN_USE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE` variable,
then its value is used regardless of the setting of this policy.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to add autogen include directory to
the target's include directories.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add autogen include directory to
the target's system include directories.
