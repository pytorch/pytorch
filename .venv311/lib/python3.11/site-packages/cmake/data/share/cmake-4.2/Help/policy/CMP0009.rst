FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow symlinks by default.

In CMake 2.6.1 and below, :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` calls would follow
through symlinks, sometimes coming up with unexpectedly large result sets
because of symlinks to top level directories that contain hundreds of
thousands of files.

This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks encountered
during a :command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` call.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this
policy is to follow the symlinks.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is not
to follow the symlinks by default, but only if ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given
as an additional argument to the ``FILE`` command.
