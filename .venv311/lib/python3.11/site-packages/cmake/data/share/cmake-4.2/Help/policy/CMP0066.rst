.. versionadded:: 3.7

Honor per-config flags in :command:`try_compile` source-file signature.

The source file signature of the :command:`try_compile` command uses the value
of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable in the test project so that the
test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, CMake 3.6 and
below do not also honor config-specific compiler flags such as those in the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` variable.  CMake 3.7 and above prefer to
honor config-specific compiler flags too.  This policy provides compatibility
for projects that do not expect config-specific compiler flags to be used.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore config-specific flag
variables like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` and only use CMake's
built-in defaults for the current compiler and platform.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to honor config-specific flag
variables like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`.
