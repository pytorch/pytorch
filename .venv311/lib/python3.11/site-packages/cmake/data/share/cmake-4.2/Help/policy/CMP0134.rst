.. versionadded:: 3.24

The default registry view is ``TARGET`` for the :command:`find_file`,
:command:`find_path`, :command:`find_library`, and :command:`find_package`
commands and ``BOTH`` for the :command:`find_program` command.

The default registry views in CMake 3.23 and below are selected using the
following rules:

* if :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` has value ``8``:

  * Use view ``64`` for all ``find_*`` commands except :command:`find_program`
    command.
  * Use view ``64_32`` for :command:`find_program` command.

* if :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` has value ``4`` or is undefined:

  * Use view ``32`` for all ``find_*`` commands except :command:`find_program`
    command.
  * Use view ``32_64`` for :command:`find_program` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use registry views ``64`` and
``64_32`` or ``32_64`` and ``32`` as default, depending of
:variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` variable value.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use registry views ``TARGET`` and
``BOTH`` as default.
