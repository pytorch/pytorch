The :command:`build_name` command should not be called.

This command was added in May 2001 to compute a name for the current
operating system and compiler combination.  The command has long been
documented as discouraged and replaced by the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM`
and :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` variables.
