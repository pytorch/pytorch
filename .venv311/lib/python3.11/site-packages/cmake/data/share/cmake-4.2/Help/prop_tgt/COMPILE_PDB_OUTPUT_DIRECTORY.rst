COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.1

Output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the compiler.

.. versionadded:: 3.12

  The property value may use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
  Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
  subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
  is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` variable if it is
set when a target is created.

If the :prop_tgt:`PRECOMPILE_HEADERS_REUSE_FROM` target is set, this property
is ignored and the reusage target's value of this property is used instead.
