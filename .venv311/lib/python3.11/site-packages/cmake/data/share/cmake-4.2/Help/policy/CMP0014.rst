Input directories must have ``CMakeLists.txt``.

CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing ``CMakeLists.txt``
files in directories referenced by :command:`add_subdirectory` or  :command:`subdirs`,
treating them as if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this
:command:`cmake_policy` determines whether or not the case is an error.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error.
