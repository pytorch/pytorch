:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` build custom commands in parallel.

Visual Studio 15.8 (2017) and newer support building custom commands in
parallel.  CMake 3.27 and above prefer to enable this behavior by adding
a ``BuildInParallel`` setting to custom commands in ``.vcxproj`` files.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect this, e.g., because their custom commands were accidentally
relying on serial execution by MSBuild. To control this behavior in a more
precise way, refer to :prop_sf:`VS_CUSTOM_COMMAND_DISABLE_PARALLEL_BUILD`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not add ``BuildInParallel``.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add ``BuildInParallel`` for
VS 15.8 and newer.
