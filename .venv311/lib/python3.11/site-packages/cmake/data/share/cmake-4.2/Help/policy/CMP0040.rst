The target in the ``TARGET`` signature of :command:`add_custom_command`
must exist and must be defined in the current directory.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored a custom command created with
the ``TARGET`` signature of :command:`add_custom_command`
if the target is unknown or was defined outside the current directory.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore custom commands
for unknown targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report
an error if the target referenced in :command:`add_custom_command` is
unknown or was defined outside the current directory.
