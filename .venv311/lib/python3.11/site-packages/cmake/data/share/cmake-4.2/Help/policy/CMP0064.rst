Recognize ``TEST`` as a operator for the :command:`if` command.

The ``TEST`` operator was added to the :command:`if` command to determine if a
given test name was created by the :command:`add_test` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the ``TEST`` operator.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to interpret the ``TEST`` operator.
