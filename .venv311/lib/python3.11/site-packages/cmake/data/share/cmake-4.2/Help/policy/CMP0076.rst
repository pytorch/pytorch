.. versionadded:: 3.13

The :command:`target_sources` command converts relative paths to absolute.

In CMake 3.13 and above, the :command:`target_sources` command now converts
relative source file paths to absolute paths in the following cases:

* Source files are added to the target's :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES`
  property.
* The target's :prop_tgt:`SOURCE_DIR` property differs from
  :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.

A path that begins with a generator expression is always left unmodified.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated
to expect this behavior.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave
all relative source file paths unmodified.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this
policy is to convert relative paths to absolute according to above rules.
