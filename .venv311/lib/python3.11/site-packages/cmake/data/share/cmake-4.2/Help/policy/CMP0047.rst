Use ``QCC`` compiler id for the qcc drivers on QNX.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is
different from the GNU compiler.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``QCC`` instead
of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
QNX qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to
report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or
:command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use the ``GNU`` compiler id
for the qcc and QCC compiler drivers. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy
is to use the ``QCC`` compiler id for those drivers.

variable to control the warning in CMake versions before 4.0.
