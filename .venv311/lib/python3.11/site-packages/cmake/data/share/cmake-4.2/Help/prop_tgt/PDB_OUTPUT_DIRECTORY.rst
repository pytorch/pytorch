PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbols ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the linker.

.. versionadded:: 3.12

  The property value may use
  :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.
  Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
  subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
  is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the
:variable:`CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` variable if it is
set when a target is created.
