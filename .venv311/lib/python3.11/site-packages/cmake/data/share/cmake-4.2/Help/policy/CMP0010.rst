Bad variable reference syntax is an error.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as
a missing close-brace (``${FOO``) was reported but did not stop
processing of CMake code.  This policy determines whether a bad
variable reference is an error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is
to warn about the error, leave the string untouched, and continue.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error.

If :policy:`CMP0053` is set to ``NEW``, this policy has no effect
and is treated as always being ``NEW``.
