Disallow use of the LOCATION property for build targets.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target
property (and configuration-specific variants) to
determine the eventual location of build targets.  This relies on the
assumption that all necessary information is available at
configure-time to determine the final location and filename of the
target.  However, this property is not fully determined until later at
generate-time.  At generate time, the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator
expression can be used to determine the eventual :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` of a target
output.

Code which reads the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target property can be ported to
use the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator expression together with the
:command:`file(GENERATE)` subcommand to generate a file containing
the target location.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION`
properties from build-targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
not to allow reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` properties from build-targets.
