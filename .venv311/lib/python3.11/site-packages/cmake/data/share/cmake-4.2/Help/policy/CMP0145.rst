.. versionadded:: 3.27

The :module:`Dart` and :module:`FindDart` modules are removed.

These modules were added very early in CMake's development to support
driving tests with a "DART" tool, but DART has not been distributed or
maintained for many years.  Projects would ``include(Dart)`` to use it,
and the ``Dart`` module would run ``find_package(Dart)`` internally.
Since :manual:`ctest(1)` was created, the ``Dart`` module has just been
a compatibility shim that finds ``Dart`` to support some legacy
functionality and then forwards to the :module:`CTest` module.

CMake 3.27 and above prefer to not provide the :module:`Dart` or
:module:`FindDart` modules.  This policy provides compatibility for
projects that have not been ported away from them.  Projects using the
``Dart`` module should be updated to use the :module:`CTest` module directly.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``include(Dart)`` and
``find_package(Dart)`` to load the deprecated modules.  The ``NEW``
behavior is for uses of the modules to fail as if they do not exist.
