Disallow include export result.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed use of the :command:`include` command with the
result of the :command:`export` command.  This relies on the assumption that
the :command:`export` command has an immediate effect at configure-time during
a cmake run.  Certain properties of targets are not fully determined
until later at generate-time, such as the link language and complete
list of link libraries.  Future refactoring will change the effect of
the :command:`export` command to be executed at generate-time.  Use ``ALIAS``
targets instead in cases where the goal is to refer to targets by
another name.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow including the result of
an :command:`export` command.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is not to
allow including the result of an :command:`export` command.
