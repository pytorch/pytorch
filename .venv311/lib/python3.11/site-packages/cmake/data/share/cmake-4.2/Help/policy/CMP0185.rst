.. versionadded:: 4.0

:module:`FindRuby` no longer provides upper-case ``RUBY_*`` variables.

:module:`FindRuby` in CMake 3.31 and below provided result variables
named with an upper-case ``RUBY_`` prefix.  CMake 3.18 renamed them
with a ``Ruby_`` prefix to match the name of the package, but continued
to provide the upper-case ``RUBY_`` variables for compatibility.

CMake 4.0 and above prefer to provide only ``Ruby_`` variables and no
longer provide ``RUBY_`` variables.  This policy provides compatibility
with projects that have not been updated.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to provide both ``Ruby_`` and
``RUBY_`` variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to provide
only ``Ruby_`` variables and not ``RUBY_`` variables.
