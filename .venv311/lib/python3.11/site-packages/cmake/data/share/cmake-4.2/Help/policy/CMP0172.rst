.. versionadded:: 3.31

The :module:`CPack` module enables per-machine installation by default
in the :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator`.

The :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator`'s :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE`
option controls the scope of the generated Windows Installer package.
When :variable:`CPACK_WIX_VERSION` is set to 4 or higher, the default scope
is ``perMachine``.  However, when using WIX 3 the default scope is ``NONE``,
and CPack does not set any ``InstallScope`` in the package specification.
The resulting installer requires administrative privileges and installs
into the system-wide ``ProgramFiles`` directory, but the start menu entry
and uninstaller registration are created only for the current user.

The :module:`CPack` module in CMake 3.30 and older does not specify any
:variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` value by default, so CPack uses no
installation scope by default with WIX 3.  CMake 3.31 and newer instead
prefer to set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` to ``perMachine`` by
default to make the behavior consistent across all WIX versions.  This
policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect ``perMachine`` behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not set
:variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` by default.  The ``NEW`` behavior for
this policy is to set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` to ``perMachine``
by default.
