# Lintrunner

## Overview
`lintrunner` is a tool that runs linters. It is responsible for:
- Deciding which files need to be linted.
- Invoking linters according to a common protocol.
- Gathering results and presenting them to users.

The intention is to provide a universal way to configure and invoke linters,
which is useful on large polyglot projects.

The design of `lintrunner` is heavily inspired by `linttool`, a project that exists internally at Meta.

## Installation
```
pip install lintrunner
```

## Usage
First, you need to add a configuration file to your repo. See the [Linter
configuration](#linter-configuration) section for more info.

Then, simply run `lintrunner` to lint your changes!

## How to control what paths to lint `lintrunner`
When run with no arguments, `lintrunner` will check:
- The files changed in the `HEAD` commit.
- The files changed in the user’s working tree.

It does *not* check:
- Any files not tracked by `git`; `git add` them to lint them.

There are multiple ways to customize how paths are checked:

### Pass paths as positional arguments
For example:
```
lintrunner foo.py bar.cpp
```

This naturally composes with `xargs`, for example the canonical way to check
every path in the repo is:
```
git grep -Il . | xargs lintrunner
```

### `--configs`/ `--config`
"Comma-separated paths to lintrunner configuration files.
Multiple files are merged, with later definitions overriding earlier ones.
ONLY THE FIRST is required to be present on your machine.
Defaults to `lintrunner.toml, lintrunner.private.toml`. Extra configs like `lintrunner.private.toml`
 are useful for combining project-wide and local configs."

### `--paths-cmd`
Some ways to invoke `xargs` will cause multiple `lintrunner` processes to be
run, increasing lint time (especially on huge path sets). As an alternative that
gives `lintrunner` control of parallelization, you can use `--paths-cmd`. If
`--paths-cmd` is specified `lintrunner` will execute that command and consider
each line of its `stdout` to be a file to lint.

For example, the same command above would be:
```
lintrunner --paths-cmd='git grep -Il .'
```

### `--paths-file`
If this is specified, `lintrunner` will read paths from the given file, one per
line, and check those. This can be useful if you have some really complex logic
to determine which paths to check.

### `--revision`
This value can be any `<tree-ish>` accepted by `git diff-tree`, like a commit
hash or revspec. If this is specified, `lintrunner` will check:
- All paths changed from `<tree-ish>` to `HEAD`
- All paths changed in the user's working tree.

### `--merge-base-with`
Like `--revision`, except the revision is determined by computing the merge-base
of `HEAD` and the provided `<tree-ish>`. This is useful for linting all commits
in a specific pull request. For example, for a pull request targeting master,
you can run:
```
lintrunner -m master
```

### `--all-files`
This will run lint on all files specified in `.lintrunner.toml`.

### `--only-lint-under-config-dir`
If set, will only lint files under the directory where the configuration file is located and its subdirectories.

## Linter configuration
`lintrunner` knows which linters to run and how by looking at a configuration
file, conventionally named `.lintrunner.toml`.

Here is an example linter configuration:

```toml
merge_base_with = 'main'

[[linter]]
name = 'FLAKE8'
include_patterns = [
  'src/**/*.py',  # unix-style globs supported
  'test/**/*.py',
]
exclude_patterns = ['src/my_bad_file.py']
command = [
  'python3',
  'flake8_linter.py',
  '—-',
  # {{PATHSFILE}} gets rewritten to a tmpfile containing all paths to lint
  '@{{PATHSFILE}}',
]
```

A complete description of the configuration schema can be found
[here](https://docs.rs/lintrunner/latest/lintrunner/lint_config/struct.LintConfig.html).

## Linter protocol
Most linters have their own output format and arguments. In order to impose
consistency on linter invocation and outputs, `lintrunner` implements a protocol
that it expects linters to fulfill. In most cases, a small script (called a
*linter adapter*) is required to implement the protocol for a given external
linter. You can see some example adapters in  `examples/` .

### Invocation
Linters will be invoked according to the `command` specified by their
configuration. They will be called once per lint run.

If a linter needs to know which paths to run on, it should take a
`{{PATHSFILE}}` argument. During invocation, the string `{{PATHSFILE}}` will be
replaced with the name of a temporary file containing which paths the linter
should run on, one path per line.

A common way to implement this in a linter adapter is to use `argparse`’s
[`fromfile_prefix_chars`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#fromfile-prefix-chars)
feature. In the Flake8 example above, we use `@` as the `fromfile_prefix_chars`
argument, so `argparse` will automatically read the `{{PATHSFILE}}` and supply
its contents as a list of arguments.

### Output
Any lint messages a linter would like to communicate the user must be
represented as a `LintMessage`. The linter, must print `LintMessage`s  as [JSON
Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) to `stdout`, one message per line. Output to
`stderr` will be ignored.

A complete description of the LintMessage schema can be found
[here](https://docs.rs/lintrunner/latest/lintrunner/lint_message/struct.LintMessage.html).

### Exiting
Linters **should always exit with code 0**. This is true even if lint errors are
reported; `lintrunner` itself will determine how to exit based on what linters
report.

To signal a general linter failure (which should ideally never happen!), linters
can return a `LintMessage` with `path = None`.

In the event a linter exits non-zero, it will be caught by `lintrunner`and
presented as a “general linter failure” with stdout/stderr shown to the user.
This should be considered a bug in the linter’s implementation of this protocol.

## Tips for adopting `lintrunner` in a new project

When adopting lintrunner in a previously un-linted project, it may generate a lot
of lint messages. You can use the `--output oneline` option to make
`lintrunner` display each lint message in its separate line to quickly navigate
through them.

Additionally, you can selectively run specific linters with the `--take` option,
like `--take RUFF,CLANGFORMAT`, to focus on resolving specific lint errors, or
use `--skip` to skip a long running linter like `MYPY`.

## GitHub Action
