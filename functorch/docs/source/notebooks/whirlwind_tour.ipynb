    "## What is functorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "functorch is a library for [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)-like composable function transforms in PyTorch.\n",
    "- A \"function transform\" is a higher-order function that accepts a numerical function and returns a new function that computes a different quantity.\n",
    "- functorch has auto-differentiation transforms (`grad(f)` returns a function that computes the gradient of `f`), a vectorization/batching transform (`vmap(f)` returns a function that computes `f` over batches of inputs), and others.\n",
    "- These function transforms can compose with each other arbitrarily. For example, composing `vmap(grad(f))` computes a quantity called per-sample-gradients that stock PyTorch cannot efficiently compute today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we also provide an experimental compilation transform in the `functorch.compile` namespace. Our compilation transform, named AOT (ahead-of-time) Autograd, returns to you an [FX graph](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html) (that optionally contains a backward pass), of which compilation via various backends is one path you can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why composable function transforms?\n",
    "There are a number of use cases that are tricky to do in PyTorch today:\n",
    "- computing per-sample-gradients (or other per-sample quantities)\n",
    "- running ensembles of models on a single machine\n",
    "- efficiently batching together tasks in the inner-loop of MAML\n",
    "- efficiently computing Jacobians and Hessians\n",
    "- efficiently computing batched Jacobians and Hessians\n",
    "\n",
    "Composing `vmap`, `grad`, `vjp`, and `jvp` transforms allows us to express the above without designing a separate subsystem for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the transforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### grad (gradient computation)\n",
    "\n",
    "`grad(func)` is our gradient computation transform. It returns a new function that computes the gradients of `func`. It assumes `func` returns a single-element Tensor and by default it computes the gradients of the output of `func` w.r.t. to the first input."
