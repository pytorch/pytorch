    "The neural tangent kernel (NTK) is a kernel that describes [how a neural network evolves during training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tangent_kernel). There has been a lot of research around it [in recent years](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572). This tutorial, inspired by the implementation of [NTKs in JAX](https://github.com/google/neural-tangents) (see [Fast Finite Width Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08720) for details), demonstrates how to easily compute this quantity using functorch."
