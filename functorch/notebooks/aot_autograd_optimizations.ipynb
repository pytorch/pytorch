The pointwise operators are memory bandwidth bound, and thus benefit from operator fusion. Looking closely at the numbers, the backward pass gets higher speedup. This is because forward pass has to output some intermediate tensors for gradient calculation for the backward pass, preventing it from saving some memory reads and writes.

For this experiment, we will use another partitioner called `min_cut_rematerialization_partition` to perform smarter fusion-aware recomputation. The partitioner is configurable and one can write their own partitioner to plug it in AOT Autograd."
