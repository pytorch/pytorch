# One source LINE, so the two entries agree on file AND lineno: what separates
# them can only come from the code body. This is the ACT2FN shape.
# The stateless corpus shapes are plain functions; precompile_capture takes
# either, and only the guard sources matter here.
# The modules the corpus needs on disk, because a dispatch read off another
# module cannot be spelled inside this file. Written under one directory so
# they import each other by plain name, exactly as a user package would.
# Every shape below was once a silent wrong answer on a serving machine that
# somebody had to find by hand. _is_risky_drop regressed three review rounds
# running -- each fix closed the previous round's false negative and opened a
# new one -- so the shapes live in a table rather than in prose: adding one is
# a single entry, and nothing here may ever stop being flagged. Each row names
# the guard sources (by suffix) the risky-drop report must carry.
# The other half of the corpus, and the half that keeps the report worth
# reading: the lint only warns by default, so if ordinary code trips it the
# warning is noise nobody audits and nobody ever opts into enforcement. Each
# row names the identity guards (by suffix) that ARE dropped without being
# flagged: torch internals, stdlib modules and their attributes, a global bound
# to a def of its own name, reads off Dynamo's import aliases and its builtins
# dict.
# A value crossing a graph break or arriving as a non-tensor argument is
# guarded by equality, so the artifact only serves inputs reproducing it, and
# nothing else in the summary says so. Model config -- LayerNorm eps, Dropout p,
# a plain int attribute -- is CONSTANT_MATCH too but constant for the model the
# artifact is loaded onto; counting it would flag every model. Rows: builder,
# args, the wont_generalize report, and a (type, source substring) guard that
# must have been KEPT, so a row cannot pass by Dynamo not emitting the guard.
# Rows: builder, example_inputs, text the invariants file must contain, and a
# pattern it must not -- object ids, the per-process counter in Dynamo's
# builtins-dict name, and the address install_global_by_id bakes into an
# identifier ("<prefix>_<id(value)>_c<n>": `type(x) is torch.Tensor` installs
# one) are all normalized so the file is stable enough to commit and diff.
# Shapes where the guard that SPLIT two compilations must show up as varying
# and never as an invariant of both. Rows: builder, capture kwargs, calls,
# substrings some varying fact must carry, substrings some invariant fact must
# carry, substrings no invariant fact may carry.
# A pair that differs only after the break, so a resume function borrowed from
# the wrong artifact still runs and still returns a number.
# Content-addressing the resume code tells the first pair apart, but not two
# instances of ONE model class: the same script captured in two processes
# mints the same __resume_at_<offset>_<n> AND byte-identical resume code.
# Rows: fn, the captured variants as (PRECOMPILE_CONFIG mode, extra args), one
# uncaptured variant, guard types that must be emitted AND kept, and whether
# save() has to be told the drops it reports are acknowledged risky ones.
# functools.wraps copies __qualname__, so an instrumented wrapper around a
# different callable passes the qualname check while being a different code
# object.
# CompilePackage rebinds the stored guards onto whatever callable it is given,
# so load has to refuse anything but the captured callable itself; a __code__
# that is present and None gets past the capture-side hasattr check.
# How the saved artifact is damaged (None: the path is a directory, the
# pre-single-file layout) and the error precompile_load must name it with.
# A legacy package's empty frame installs a skip only in its region; whatever
# global strategy the frame had before the load, or gained while loaded, has
# to be what unload leaves. Rows: applied before the load, applied after it,
# the (cur, recursive) strategy expected after unload.
