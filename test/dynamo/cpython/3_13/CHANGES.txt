This subdirectory contains a selection of tests from the CPython repository (branch: v3.13.0):\
https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v3.13.0

Modifications were made to ensure compatibility with the Dynamo infrastructure:
+ Monkey-patched `unittest.TestCase` to `torch._dynamo.test_case.CPythonTestCase`.
+ Replaced `unittest.main()` with `torch._dynamo.test_case.run_tests()`.
+ Assigned test "owners."
+ Annotated CPU-intensive tests with the `@slowTest` decorator.
+ Adjusted imports to use `import module` instead of `from test import module`.
