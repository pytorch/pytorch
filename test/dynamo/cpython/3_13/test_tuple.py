# Notes on testing hash codes.  The primary thing is that Python doesn't
# care about "random" hash codes.  To the contrary, we like them to be
# very regular when possible, so that the low-order bits are as evenly
# distributed as possible.  For integers this is easy: hash(i) == i for
# all not-huge i except i==-1.
#
# For tuples of mixed type there's really no hope of that, so we want
# "randomish" here instead.  But getting close to pseudo-random in all
# bit positions is more expensive than we've been willing to pay for.
#
# We can tolerate large deviations from random - what we don't want is
# catastrophic pileups on a relative handful of hash codes.  The dict
# and set lookup routines remain effective provided that full-width hash
# codes for not-equal objects are distinct.
#
# So we compute various statistics here based on what a "truly random"
# hash would do, but don't automate "pass or fail" based on those
# results.  Instead those are viewed as inputs to human judgment, and the
# automated tests merely ensure we get the _same_ results across
# platforms.  In fact, we normally don't bother to run them at all -
# set RUN_ALL_HASH_TESTS to force it.
#
# When global JUST_SHOW_HASH_RESULTS is True, the tuple hash statistics
# are just displayed to stdout.  A typical output line looks like:
#
# old tuple test; 32-bit upper hash codes; \
#             pileup 49 mean 7.4 coll 52 z +16.4
#
# "old tuple test" is just a string name for the test being run.
#
# "32-bit upper hash codes" means this was run under a 64-bit build and
# we've shifted away the lower 32 bits of the hash codes.
#
# "pileup" is 0 if there were no collisions across those hash codes.
# It's 1 less than the maximum number of times any single hash code was
# seen.  So in this case, there was (at least) one hash code that was
# seen 50 times:  that hash code "piled up" 49 more times than ideal.
#
# "mean" is the number of collisions a perfectly random hash function
# would have yielded, on average.
#
# "coll" is the number of collisions actually seen.
#
# "z" is "coll - mean" divided by the standard deviation of the number
# of collisions a perfectly random hash function would suffer.  A
# positive value is "worse than random", and negative value "better than
# random".  Anything of magnitude greater than 3 would be highly suspect
# for a hash function that claimed to be random.  It's essentially
# impossible that a truly random function would deliver a result 16.4
# sdevs "worse than random".
#
# But we don't care here!  That's why the test isn't coded to fail.
# Knowing something about how the high-order hash code bits behave
# provides insight, but is irrelevant to how the dict and set lookup
# code performs.  The low-order bits are much more important to that,
# and on the same test those did "just like random":
#
# old tuple test; 32-bit lower hash codes; \
#            pileup 1 mean 7.4 coll 7 z -0.2
#
# So there are always tradeoffs to consider.  For another:
#
# 0..99 << 60 by 3; 32-bit hash codes; \
#            pileup 0 mean 116.4 coll 0 z -10.8
#
# That was run under a 32-bit build, and is spectacularly "better than
# random".  On a 64-bit build the wider hash codes are fine too:
#
# 0..99 << 60 by 3; 64-bit hash codes; \
#             pileup 0 mean 0.0 coll 0 z -0.0
#
# but their lower 32 bits are poor:
#
# 0..99 << 60 by 3; 32-bit lower hash codes; \
#             pileup 1 mean 116.4 coll 324 z +19.2
#
# In a statistical sense that's waaaaay too many collisions, but (a) 324
# collisions out of a million hash codes isn't anywhere near being a
# real problem; and, (b) the worst pileup on a single hash code is a measly
# 1 extra.  It's a relatively poor case for the tuple hash, but still
# fine for practical use.
#
# This isn't, which is what Python 3.7.1 produced for the hashes of
# itertools.product([0, 0.5], repeat=18).  Even with a fat 64-bit
# hashcode, the highest pileup was over 16,000 - making a dict/set
# lookup on one of the colliding values thousands of times slower (on
# average) than we expect.
#
# [0, 0.5] by 18; 64-bit hash codes; \
#            pileup 16,383 mean 0.0 coll 262,128 z +6073641856.9
# [0, 0.5] by 18; 32-bit lower hash codes; \
#            pileup 262,143 mean 8.0 coll 262,143 z +92683.6
