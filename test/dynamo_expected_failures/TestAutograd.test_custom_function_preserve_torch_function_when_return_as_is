- Need to handle `class` block inside `torch.compile` region (`LOAD_BUILD_CLASS`)
or properly graph break on it rather than skipping the frame altogether.

Fundamental issue is Dynamo tries to probe tensor object properties, but that
could trigger user-defined `__torch_function__` for tensor subclass objects.

In this case the `LOAD_BUILD_CLASS` error caused Dynamo to start tracing in the
`__init__` of the following class, but `self._data = data` hasn't fired yet, and
its `__torch_function__` errors when Dynamo is probing tensor property
