# Note [Don't serialize hooks]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Since time immemorial, we have serialized the backward hooks associated with
# variables.  This kind of half-worked--Python can pickle global functions
# (but not closures!)--but there were problems.
#
#   - It's fragile.  If you serialize a backward hook into a saved
#     model, and then you rename the function associated with the hook,
#     now your saved model is broken and you can't load it anymore.
#
#   - It's not actually used.  The standard recommendation is to
#     serialize the *state_dict* of a model, not the model itself
#     (since this is more stable to code changes affecting the model
#     serialization), and the state dict saves "data" only, thus
#     stripping the the backward hooks.  In some cases, hooks are
#     essential to the well-functioning of a model (e.g., DDP),
#     but DDP already manages readding the hooks!
#
#   - We didn't serialize them in many cases.  Prior to #10220, we
#     were dropping backward hooks in ForkingPickler.  We "fixed" this
#     to be convenient with other serialization sites, but lack of
#     serializing backward hooks wasn't actually the root cause of
#     the bug.
#
# With these cases in mind, we have decided that a better strategy
# is to just NOT serialize hooks at all.
#
# Since this is a BC-breaking change, we should warn when we previously
# serialized a hook, but no longer do so. This will be done by adding a special
# sentinel property to hooks will be used to suppress this warning. If a hook
# has the property _torch_serialize_ignore, we will not emit a warning if we
# attempt to serialize a Tensor with this hook attached to it.
#
# By the way, when _backward_hooks is skipped, we must give an EMPTY
# OrderedDict(), if you pass a None you'll run afoul #12219.
