# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# AOT Autograd contains a pretty non-trivial amount of logic to handle edge cases around aliasing and mutation
# that are external to the graph (they show up as side effects in some way when you run the graph).
#
# Take a look at `test_aotdispatch.py TestAOTAutograd.test_input_mutation*` tests for some examples functions
# and what they're compiled graphs looks like.
# Below is a very long comment detailing several edge cases, and showing how AOT Autograd handles them.
#
# Note [AOT Autograd: input data mutations]
#
# If we compile a function that mutates inputs, then those input mutations are real side effects
# that a user expects to see after running the compiled graph.
# However, the graph that we want to send to a backend needs to be *entirely* functional.
# The way we reconcile this difference is that we remove the mutations completely from the graph that we compile
# but we update the graph to return (updated_inputs, user_outputs).
# In the epilogue that runs after the compiled graph is executed, we copy the updated inputs back to the originals.
#
# Example: original user code:
# def f(x):
#     x.mul_(2)
#     out = x.mul(3)
#     return out
#
# After AOT Autograd compiles, we end up with a:
# (a) compiled graph
# (b) autograd.Function.forward() method, that executes the compiled graph
# (c) wrapper function, that calls the autograd.Function.forward() and performs the epilogue
#
# The output of (a, b, c) are all written below.
#
# def compiled_forward_graph(x):
#     x_updated = x.mul(2)
#     out = x_updated.mul(3)
#     return x_updated, out
#
# # x_updated gets a gradient in the compiled backward
# def compiled_backward_graph(grad_x_updated, grad_out):
#     grad_x = ...
#     return grad_x
#
# def autograd.Function.forward(x):
#     x_updated, out = compiled_forward_graph(x)
#     return x_updated, out
#
# def compiled_wrapper(x):
#     x_updated, out = autograd.Function.apply(x)
#     x.copy_(x_updated)
#     return out
#
# Another important thing to note is that updated inputs (due to data mutations) *do* participate
# in the compiled backward graph! Since the compiled forward graph gets N extra outputs
# (due to updated inputs showing up as graph outputs),
# The compiled backward gets an additional N inputs.
# That way, during the x.copy_(x_updated) bit in the epilogue, gradients will flow from the updated input
# back to the original input.


# Note [AOT Autograd: input metadata mutations]
#
# For the same reason as input mutations, we also don't put input metadata mutations in the graph.
# Instead, we return the updated version of the input (a view), and mutate the input's metadata outside of the graph
#
# Example: original user code:
# def f(x):
#     x.t_()
#     out = x.mul(3)
#     return out
#
# AOT Autograd output (compiled graph, autograd.Function.forward(), wrapper function):
# def compiled_forward_graph(x):
#     x_updated = x.t()
#     out = x_updated.mul(3)
#     return x_updated, out
#
# # x_updated does *not* get a gradient in the compiled backward
# def compiled_backward_graph(grad_out):
#     grad_x = ...
#     return grad_x
#
# def autograd.Function.forward(x):
#     x_updated, out = compiled_forward_graph(x)
#     return x_updated, out
#
# def compiled_wrapper(x):
#     x_updated, out = autograd.Function.apply(x)
#     x.as_strided_(x_updated)
#     return out


# Note [AOT Autograd: outputs aliasing inputs or intermediates!]
#
# AOT Autograd needs special handling for outputs that alias graph inputs or intermediates!
# Why?
# (1) autograd.Function.forward() has a limitation, where views that returned in the forward cannot later be mutated.
# (2) views don't need to be compiled in the graph anyway - it's cheap to generate them outside of the compiled graph,
#     in an epilogue.
# For outputs that alias inputs, we do the following:
# (a) *still* return the aliased output as a graph output
# (b) In the AOT Autograd wrapper/epilogue, we don't return that aliased output. Instead, we use it to regenerate the output.
#
# For outputs that alias *intermediates*, we do the following:
# (a) Return the output in the compiled forward, **and** return it's ._base (a graph intermediates) as an output in the forward
# (b) Use (output, graph_intermediate) to regenerate the alias, and return that to the user (instead of the compiled fw output).
# You might wonder why we return the aliased output directly in the graph (and making the graph compute it),
# only to not return it and instead generate a fresh alias off of the intermediate,
# instead of (say) just storing metadata about the size/stride of the output somewhere to generate the alias. There are two reasons:
# (1) Getting the actual alias tensor allows us to use view-replay to generate the alias, instead of an as_strided() call
# (2) Inductor (and other backends) are free to change the memory format of graph outputs, if it results in better performance.
#     This can result in problems if a user later tries to .view() that output expecting it to have one set of strides,
#     when it has a different set of strides.
#     By including the view op directly in the graph, inductor takes that into account when deciding what memory format
#     the graph intermediate should be.
#
# Another important thing to note is how our traced backward() graph handles aliases.
# (this applies to outputs aliasing inputs, outputs aliasing intermediates,
#  *and* updated inputs returned in the compiled forward due to metadata-only mutations).
# Any outputs that alias (either inputs or intermediates) do NOT participate in the compiled backward graph
# It would be wasteful to include them in the compiled backward(), because we regenerate them eagerly
# at the end of the forward.
#
# Example: original user code:
# def f(x):
#     out1 = x.t()
#     intermediate = x.mul(2)
#     out2 = intermediate.view(-1)
#     return out1, out2
#
# AOT Autograd output (compiled graph, autograd.Function.forward(), wrapper function):
# def compiled_forward_graph(x):
#     out1 = x.t()
#     intermediate = x.mul(2)
#     out2 = intermediate.view(-1)
#     # the compiled graph also returns the intermediate
#     return out1, out2, intermediate
#
# # intermediate gets a gradient in the compiled backward.
# # both output aliases (out1 and out2) do not.
# def compiled_backward_graph(grad_intermediate):
#     grad_x = ...
#     return grad_x
#
# def autograd.Function.forward(x):
#     out1, out2, intermediate = compiled_forward_graph(x)
#     return out1, out2, intermediate
#
# def compiled_wrapper(x):
#     out1, out2, intermediate = autograd.Function.apply(x)
#     # regenerate out1 from the input
#     out1_regenerated = out1._view_func(x)
#     # regenerate out1 from the intermediate
#     out2_regenerated = out2._view_func(intermediate)
#     return out1_regenerated, out2_regenerated


# Note [AOT Autograd: mutations to inputs that alias other inputs]
#
# Another edge case that is (only partially) handled today is when an input is mutated, but itself aliases another input.
# AOT Autograd needs to **ensure** that functionalization knows that the two inputs are aliased to each other.
# That way, when the aliased input is accessed later in the graph, functionalization knows to "update" the alias
# given the mutation that occurred.
#
# This is handled by updating the calling convention: we create a "synthetic base" that becomes a new input
# in the compiled function, and we regenerate the original (aliased) inputs directly off of the base
# inside of the compiled function.
#
# This logic is fully encapsulated in aot_wrapper_synthetic_base()
#
# Example: original user code:
# def f(x, x_view):
#     x.mul_(2)
#     out = x * x_view
#     return out
# f(x, x.view(-1))
#
# AOT Autograd output (compiled graph, autograd.Function.forward(), wrapper function):
# def compiled_forward_graph(base)
#     x = generate_x(base)
#     x_view = generate_x_view(base)
#     x_updated = x.mul(2)
#     x_view_updated = x_updated.view(-1)
#     out = x_updated * x_view_updated
#     return x_updated, out
#
# # The calling convention change from (aliases) -> (base) happens
# # *outside* of the autograd.Function.forward().
# # That means the forward() only has 1 input (base),
# # and the backward() only has 1 output (grad_base)
# def compiled_backward_graph(grad_out):
#     grad_base = ...
#     return grad_base
#
# def autograd.Function.forward(base):
#     x_updated, out = compiled_forward_graph(base)
#     return x_updated, out
#
# # The compiled wrapper is where we create synthetic bases.
# # The info on which inputs are mutated is also tracked *before* synthetic base creation.
# def compiled_wrapper(x, x_view):
#     base = merge_view_inputs(x, x_view)
#     x_updated, out = autograd.Function.apply(base)
#     # x and x_view are aliased in eager mode, so this mutation to x will automatically affect x_view.
#     x.copy_(x_updated)
#     return out


# Note [AOT Autograd: Views to avoid tangents aliasing inputs]
#
# We view every forward output when creating out tangent tensors to handle the problematic
# case in which a subclass does extra aliasing between graph outputs/inputs in a way that
# is not visible above the sublass.
#
# Ordinarily, when constructing the joint function that we want to trace in AOTAutograd,
# we're guaranteed that the tangent tensors that we pass
# into the joint are distinct tensors from the primals. This is because when
# decide which forward outputs to create tangents for, we only create tangents
# for forward outputs that are not aliases of inputs (See Note
# [AOT Autograd: outputs aliasing inputs or intermediates!]).
#
# However, when wrapper tensor subclasses enter the picture, it is possible
# to have an output of the forward that is a subclass that is not an
# input / alias of an input, but one of its inner tensors is an alias!
# NestedTensor is an example: Performing an out-of-place pointwise op on a
# NestedTensor constructs a fresh NestedTensor that holds onto the input's
# offsets tensor directly.
#
# Having tangent tensors that are the same as the (primal) forward inputs,
# can cause problems during tracing as make_fx() will specialize on our
# duplicate inputs: If we passed in the same tensor for primals_1 and
# tangents_1 during tracing, make_fx() will happily sub out all usages of
# tangents_1 with primals_1 in the graph, which is not what we want.
#
# To work around this, we view every forward output when creating out tangent
# tensors so that tangents can never be the same as forward inputs even if
# forward inputs alias forward outputs.

# Note [Side-Effectful Tokens in AOTAutograd]
#
# We allow some some side-effectful operators in
# the post-AOTAutograd (functional) graph, such as prints and torchbind operations.
# To ensure that these side-effects are compatible to future graph passes that
# assume that the graph is functional, we will thread "effect tokens" to show
# data dependence between these side-effectful operators. Practically speaking,
# effect tokens are just dummy values (torch.tensor([])). The graph would look
# like the following:
#
# def gm(self, token0, reader):
#    token1, frame = with_token(ordered_effect_op, (reader,), token0)
#    frame = frame * 2
#    token2, frame2 = with_token(ordered_effect_op, (reader,), token1)
#    frame2 = frame2 * 2
#    return token2, frame, frame2
#
# We will pass the token as an input to the graph, thread it through
# side-effectful operators using the `with_effects` high order operator, and then
# return the updated token as an output.
# So the signature of the graph input would look something like
# (*tokens, *params_buffers, *user_inputs), and the signature of the graph
# output would look something like (*tokens, *outputs).
#
# However, Inductor does not want the concept of tokens in the final generated
# code's input and output. Since changing the graph signature inside of inductor
# is difficult, after generating the forward graph, we will run a pass to
# remove the tokens from the inputgenerate the following graph for Inductor, where
# the tokens are created and sunk within the graph, rather than as inputs and
# outputs:
#
# def gm(self, reader):
#    token0 = torch.ops.prims._make_token()
#    token1, frame = with_token(ordered_effect_op, (reader,), token0)
#    frame = frame * 2
#    token2, frame2 = with_token(ordered_effect_op, (reader,), token1)
#    frame2 = frame2 * 2
#    sink_token = torch.ops.prims._sink_tokens([token2])
#    return frame, frame2

    The traced FX graph will have the following properties compared to the original module:
    (1) Inputs and outputs to the module will be pytree-flattened
    (2) Parameters and buffers on the module will be lifted into graph inputs,
        graph_inputs = (*parameters, *buffers, *user_inputs)
    (3) The graph will be fully functionalized
    (4) Any input mutations will be converted into additional outputs in the graph,

        back to the original inputs.
    (5) If is_joint is provided the graph will return parameter gradients in addition to user outputs.

        which is specified with `output_loss_index`.
        All other outputs to the forward are presumed to not require gradients.
    (2) This API cannot capture optimizers (although in theory we could build an API for this).
    (3) Metadata mutations on params/buffers/inputs are banned.
    (4) Data mutations on anything that requires gradients are banned (parameters)
    (5) If an input is mutated, it is not allowed to alias any other inputs.
    (6) Parameters must not be duplicated.

    (2) `func` cannot mutate any inputs
    (3) The outputs of `func` cannot alias any inputs.

    Note: this function is only lightly tested today. It will probably be tested more heavily by higher order ops.
