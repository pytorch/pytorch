    But the user's original model may have subclass inputs and outputs.
    So we need to wrap/unwrap subclasses as necessary to translate between the user's
    view (subclass inps/outs), and the backend compiler's view (graph with no subclass args).

    Complications arise mostly from the fact that a subclass can hold more than one inner tensor;
    So for a given subclass input/output, we need to carefully track which indices map
    to the subclass tensor in the corresponding "dense-tensor-only" graph.

    # In the above example, the .grad field of *both* DoubleTensor and DenseTensor will be a DoubleTensor.
