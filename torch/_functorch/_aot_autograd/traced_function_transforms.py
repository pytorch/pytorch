"""
This module is responsible for transforming functions to be traced into a form
that is easier for the downstream infra (e.g. Autograd, FX, AOTAutograd analysis)
to handle.

It does so by:
1. functionalization (including RNG functionalzation)
2. creating a joint graph when required
3. transforming mutations into extra outputs
4. dispatching subclasses

    #     to outputs of the forward graph.
    # How do tensor subclasses enter the picture?
    # the num_fwd_outputs in the final graph is actually non-trivial to compute,
    # because it can be influenced by input mutations and intermediate bases.

    # However, the original ViewAndMutationMeta that we computed was created
    # on the subclass -> subclass graph,
    # which can have a different number of outputs than the dense -> dense graph.
    # That's why we created a fresh metadata object on the dense -> dense function here,
    # and plumb it back up to the partitioner.
