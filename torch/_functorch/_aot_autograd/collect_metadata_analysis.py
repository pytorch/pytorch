"""
This module is one of the analysis modules - it takes as input a function or graph
and some preexisting properties, and returns some data that is useful for deciding
how to further proceed with compilation or construct runtime wrappers.

In particular, the analysis here constructs view and mutation metadata from running
a functionalized version of the graph under compilation.

    # To handle this situation, we have two new methods that a tensor subclass can implement:
    # (1) __coerce_tangent_metadata__(self)
    #     Given a subclass with "non-standard" metadata, turn it into a new subclass with "normal" metadata.

    #     with a Replicate/Shard placement, we have no way to convert the tangent "back" to a _Partial placement.
    #     This method lets us avoid the problem entirely by allowing subclasses to ensure that we can never
    #     have a tangent with "problematic" metadata, that we cannot convert to.
    # (1) __coerce_same_metadata_as_tangent__(self, metadata)
    #     Given a subclass, and a target differing metadata,
    #     convert self to have the same metadata as the target.
    #     With DTensor being the main example, we can use this to convert a DTensor with a Replicate()
    #     placement into one with a Shard() placement, in the case that we "guessed wrong",

# This is a version of functionalization that is specifically designed
# for the AOTAutograd use case.
#
# Unlike functorch's variant, this doesn't use the functorch level system,
# instead it directly uses PyTorch's conventional dispatcher to hit the
# functionalization key.  In particular, this means that FunctionalTensorWrapper
# can have autograd data stored directly on it.
#
# In typical AOTAutograd usage, the dispatch key order will look like:
#
#   Autograd - Functionalization ~~~~> Proxy Mode - Fake Tensor
#       outer tensor                        inner tensor
#
# Returns:
# - ViewAndMutationMeta, telling us metadata about the inputs and outputs, and
#   The list of outputs from the forward, but **only** the outputs that we need
#   to pass in as tangents into the backward.
#   Specifically, aliased outputs from the forward get regenerated, and don't participate
#   in the compiled backward function.

                # Before describing the optimization: this is important for AOTAutograd to have good

                # - There is a more generic change to AOTAutograd that we'd like to make, that subsumes this case,
                #   around using pre-dispatch tracing to partition out a graph so we can faithfully replay all
                #   views without having to regenerate them at runtime.
                # - It's loosely described in this doc (more details will be added soon):
                #   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlfFq8TKbuAn2zyJxLfoW-X1qkkm5PLdHFtySo03QAk/edit
                # - Once that change lands, we should just rip out this "optimization", since:
                #   (1) It will be fully unnecessary
                #   (2) Although it is only a few lines of code, it is a bit difficult to reason about
                #       its correctness with the autograd engine in all cases.
                #
                #
                # What is this optimization? Consider the below case:
                # def f(x):
                #     intermediate = x.mul(2)
                #     # x and intermediate here require grad
                #     o1, o2, ... o10 = intermediate.unbind(-1)
                #     return intermediate, o1, o2, ... o10
                # Now, the "intermediate base" handling in AOTAutograd implies that we must do the following:
                #   (1) return "intermediate as an extra output of the compiled graph
                #   (2) regenerate each aliased output off of "intermediate", **outside** of the autograd.Function.
                # The reason AOTAutograd ordinarily does this is for safety: the autograd engine needs to know
                # that o1 through o10 are all aliased, and if we blindly return o1 through o10 from the autograd.Function,
                # this information will be hidden.
                # In particular, mutating one alias might require autograd to update autograd metadata on the other aliases
                # (like their grad_fn, for example, when the autograd engine needs to do view-replay).
                #
                # However, intermediate_base logic can be bad for backward performance (we sometimes generate
                # as_strided calls during the intermediate base logic, which can have a slow backward formula).
                # Is it possible to find a set of conditions where it is **safe** to hide the output aliasing from autograd?
                #
                # For a set of outputs of the graph that alias each other, o_1...o_k, consider:
                # (1) They came from the same multi-output view op, e.g. o_1, ..., o_k = intermediate.unbind(0)
                # (2) If there are any other aliases of o_1 through o_k (in the example above, intermediate),
                #     **at most** 1 can escape from the graph (e.g. there is not some other graph input/output
                #     o_other, that aliases these outputs)
                # (3) o_1...o_k all require_grad, they all share the same ._base, and their ._base requires grad.
                #     This condition is important because it's what causes slowness in the intermediate_base
                #     codepath of aot_autograd. Ordinarily, o_1...o_k would all get a grad_fn, and
                #     aot_autograd's view-replay might give each output an AsStridedBackward as its grad_fn.

                #      the output of a function that returns multiple views. Such functions do not allow the output
                #      views to be modified inplace. You should replace the inplace operation by an out-of-place one."
                # (b) What if we take a view of o_k and mutate it, o_k.view(o_k.shape).mul_(2)?
                #     Autograd raises the same error- the "multi-output-view"ness of an alias propagates to future views.
                # (c) What if we mutate o_k under no_grad?
                #     Autograd raises the same error
                # (d) What if we detach and mutate, e.g. o_k.detach().mul_(2)?
                #     Autograd allows this, *but* autograd updates all alias's grad_fn's to be error functions when accessed.
                #     Autograd raises the same error
                # (e) What if we try to mutate another alias of o_1...o_k, that was **not** created from a multi-output view?
                #     We promised that there is at most **one** such alias, e.g. intermediate in the example above.
                #     You can mutate intermediate, but in eager mode this will change the grad_fn of o_1...o_k
                #     to be error fn's.
                #     Since intermediate was the *only* non-multi-output-alias, there are no other aliases

                #
                # Coming back to this optimization:
                # Given that it is not possible for mutating one of these aliases to affect the autograd metadata of another alias
                # without causing an error in eager mode, we will simple hide the aliasing from autograd during torch.compile
                # if all of the above conditions are met.
                # This has the slight downside that it's possible to write some "bad" code that autograd will raise an error on
                # in eager but fail to during torch.compile, but it has the benefit that this code has much better performance.
