        `torch.associative_scan` is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It currently

    This operator requires runtime code generation and so requires support for
    ``torch.compile``. Further, only CUDA device codegen is supported at the moment.

    Args:
        combine_fn (Callable): A binary callable with type ``(Tensor, Tensor) -> Tensor``,
            or if input is a pytree ``(pytree, pytree) -> pytree``.
            This function must be pure, i.e., no lifted arguments are supported at the moment,
            satisfy the associative property and have no side-effects.
        xs (torch.Tensor): The input tensor, or nested pytree of tensors.
            All inputs are expected to have the same shape.
        dim (int): the dimension to scan over
        reverse (bool): A boolean stating if the scan should be reversed with respect to ``dim``, default ``False``.
        combine_mode (str): A string indicating whether the ``combine_fn`` is ``pointwise`` or ``generic``, default ``pointwise``.
            If ``combine_mode=pointwise``, ``combine_fn`` must be pure, may only contain pointwise operations
            and ``xs`` must be CUDA tensors.
            In all other cases ``combine_mode=generic`` should be used.
            Note: ``combine_mode=pointwise`` is more efficient than ``combine_mode=generic``.

    This function performs the associative_scan operation.
    The algorithm works by recursively collecting neighbours of ``leaves`` and subsequently
    applying the ``operator`` on all pairs in parallel along ``dim``.
    The results of the recursive calls are later combined.

        operator (Callable): A binary callable with type ``(Tensor, Tensor) -> Tensor``,
            or if input is a pytree ``(pytree, pytree) -> pytree``.
            This function must be pure, pointwise, and satisfy the associative property.
        leaves (torch.Tensor): A list of torch.Tensors converted from the pytree of
            ``xs`` provided to ``associative_scan``.
            All inputs are expected to have the same shape.
        dim (int): the dimension to scan over
        additional_inputs (Tuple of tensors): A tuple of lifted parameters from the global scope.
            This parameter will be populated internally.
