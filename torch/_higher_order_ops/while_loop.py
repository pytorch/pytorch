def while_loop(cond_fn, body_fn, carried_inputs):
    r"""
    Run body_fn(*carried_inputs) while cond_fn(*carried_inputs) returns a True scalar tensor. Returns the output of body_fn or
    initial carried_inputs.

    .. warning::
        `torch.while_loop` is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It has limited support for input and output types and
        doesn't support training currently. Please look forward to a more stable implementation in a future version of PyTorch.
        Read more about feature classification at: https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-feature-classification-changes/#prototype

    `while_loop` is a structured control flow operator. It preserves the loop semantic across the torch.compile and torch.export.

    `while_loop` is equivalent to the following:

        def while_loop(cond_fn, body_fn, carried_inputs):
            val = carried_inputs
            while cond_fn(*val):
                val = body_fn(*val)
            return val

    Args:
        cond_fn (Callable): A callable function that returns a boolean Scalar tensor or a python boolean.

        body_fn (Callable): A callable function that takes the same inputs as `cond_fn` and returns a tuple of tensors or ints

        carried_inputs (Tuple of possibly nested dict/list/tuple of tensors or ints): A tuple of inputs to cond_fn and body_fn.
            It's also the initial value of states that are carried across iterations. Note that when pass an integer as carry,
            the corresponding return of while_loop will be another int with unknown values because we don't know how many
            iterations while_loop will run.

    Example 1:

        def cond_fn(iter, x):
            return iter.sum() < 10

        def body_fn(iter, x):
            return iter + 1, x.sin()

        while_loop(cond_fn, body_fn, (torch.zeros(1), torch.randn(3, 4)))

    Example 2:

        def cond_fn(int_iter, x):
            return 2 * int_iter < x.shape[0]

        def body_fn(int_iter, x):
            return int_iter + 1, x + int_iter

        while_loop(cond,_fn, body_fn, (0, torch.randn(3, 4)))

    Restrictions:

        - body_fn must return tensors or int with the same metadata (e.g.shape, dtype) as inputs.

        - body_fn and cond_fn must not in-place mutate the carried_inputs. A clone before the mutation is required.

        - body_fn and cond_fn must not mutate python varialbles (e.g. list/dict) created outside of the body_fn.

        - body_fn and cond_fn's output cannot aliase any of the inputs. A clone is required.

    .. warning::
        Temporal Limitations:

        - 'while_loop' only supports **inference** right now. Autograd will be supported in the future.

        # For carries, when we start tracing while_loop, they can be
        #   - constants e.g. (0, [1, 3])
        #   - backed symints (x.shape[0], [x.shape[1] + x.stride[1], x.shape[2]])
        #   - unbacked symints e.g. (u0, [u0 + u1, u2])
        #   We choose the most conservative design: in all cases, we create new unbacked symints to trace the
        #   subgraph. It's possible to do some analysis on initial carry and the output of first
        #   iteration to determine a better range for the output unbacked symbol e.g. when input is an unbacked
        #   symint >= 0 before the while_loop but in general this is difficult because we don't know
        #   the number of iterations. Users would have to re-constrain the unbacked symint in subgraph if needed.
        #
        # For output of fake cond_fn, it could be constant bool or SymBool (e.g. return x.shape[0] < 4,
        #   where x.shape[0] can be either static of dynamic). In the case of constant bool, we should do a
        #   specialization (NYI).

        # For output of fake body_fn, it could be all three types though from user's point of view,
        # they're all integers e.g.

        #   init_carry = (0, s0, u1, t)
        #   def body_fn(u0, s0, u1, t):
        #     ...
        #     return (t.shape[0], t.shape[1], t.shape[2], y + 1)
        #
        #   It may seem that a constant output isn't possible: users shouldn't write a while_loop
        #   that always return 0. But it could be that a shape is not set as dynamic properly (e.g.
        #   automatic dynamic hasn't been triggered).
        #
        #   For this reason, we treat int, symint outputs in the same way:
        #   - they can match against any of int, symint carry
        #   - we unspecialize them with new unbacked symints in fake while_loop
        #   Similarly, we could do some analysis to refine the output ranges but it's eaiser to start with
        #   fresh unbacked symints. One suprising case can be: an input unbacked symint is constrained by
        #   users to be >= 0 (either before while_loop or inside body_fn) and it increments by 1 in each
        #   iteration. Ideally, we should know that the final output is >= 0 but we didn't constrain the
