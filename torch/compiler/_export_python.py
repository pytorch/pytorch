"""Path-cached ``torch.compiler.export_python`` decorator.

``torch.compiler.precompile`` captures a function ahead of time and lowers it to a
self-contained, human-readable Python source artifact (see
``torch/_precompile.py``). ``torch.compiler.export_python`` wraps that in a
decorator keyed off a file on disk: the first run writes the emitted
``python_code`` to ``path``; every later run reads the ``.py`` back and executes
it directly instead of recompiling.

Because the artifact is self-contained, re-executable Python, ``path`` is meant to be
committed and shipped -- and, when a kernel starts to matter, hand-edited in place by
an engineer or an agent. This is ejectable compilation: the emitted source is the
source of truth and is always exec'd, so an edit is simply what runs from then on, in
production as much as in development. There is no acceleration cache and no
``precompile.load`` round-trip, so keeping the edited source correct is the caller's
responsibility.
