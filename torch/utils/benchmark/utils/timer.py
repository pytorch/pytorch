class Timer:
    """Helper class for measuring execution time of PyTorch statements.

    For a full tutorial on how to use this class, see:
    https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/benchmark.html

    The PyTorch Timer is based on `timeit.Timer` (and in fact uses
    `timeit.Timer` internally), but with several key differences:

    1) Runtime aware:
        Timer will perform warmups (important as some elements of PyTorch are
        lazily initialized), set threadpool size so that comparisons are
        apples-to-apples, and synchronize asynchronous accelerator functions when
        necessary.

    2) Focus on replicates:
        When measuring code, and particularly complex kernels / models,
        run-to-run variation is a significant confounding factor. It is
        expected that all measurements should include replicates to quantify
        noise and allow median computation, which is more robust than mean.
        To that effect, this class deviates from the `timeit` API by
        conceptually merging `timeit.Timer.repeat` and `timeit.Timer.autorange`.
        (Exact algorithms are discussed in method docstrings.) The `timeit`
        method is replicated for cases where an adaptive strategy is not
        desired.

    3) Optional metadata:
        When defining a Timer, one can optionally specify `label`, `sub_label`,
        `description`, and `env`. (Defined later) These fields are included in
        the representation of result object and by the `Compare` class to group
        and display results for comparison.

    4) Instruction counts
        In addition to wall times, Timer can run a statement under Callgrind
        and report instructions executed.

    Directly analogous to `timeit.Timer` constructor arguments:

        `stmt`, `setup`, `timer`, `globals`

    PyTorch Timer specific constructor arguments:

        `label`, `sub_label`, `description`, `env`, `num_threads`

    Args:
        stmt: Code snippet to be run in a loop and timed.

        setup: Optional setup code. Used to define variables used in `stmt`

        global_setup: (C++ only)
            Code which is placed at the top level of the file for things like
            `#include` statements.

        timer:
            Callable which returns the current time. If PyTorch was built
            without accelerators or there is no accelerator present, this defaults to
            `timeit.default_timer`; otherwise it will synchronize accelerators before
            measuring the time.

        globals:
            A dict which defines the global variables when `stmt` is being
            executed. This is the other method for providing variables which
            `stmt` needs.

        label:
            String which summarizes `stmt`. For instance, if `stmt` is
            "torch.nn.functional.relu(torch.add(x, 1, out=out))"
            one might set label to "ReLU(x + 1)" to improve readability.

        sub_label:
            Provide supplemental information to disambiguate measurements
            with identical stmt or label. For instance, in our example
            above sub_label might be "float" or "int", so that it is easy
            to differentiate:
            "ReLU(x + 1): (float)"

            "ReLU(x + 1): (int)"
            when printing Measurements or summarizing using `Compare`.

        description:
            String to distinguish measurements with identical label and
            sub_label. The principal use of `description` is to signal to
            `Compare` the columns of data. For instance one might set it
            based on the input size  to create a table of the form: ::

                                        | n=1 | n=4 | ...
                                        ------------- ...
                ReLU(x + 1): (float)    | ... | ... | ...
                ReLU(x + 1): (int)      | ... | ... | ...


            using `Compare`. It is also included when printing a Measurement.

        env:
            This tag indicates that otherwise identical tasks were run in
            different environments, and are therefore not equivalent, for
            instance when A/B testing a change to a kernel. `Compare` will
            treat Measurements with different `env` specification as distinct
            when merging replicate runs.

        num_threads:
            The size of the PyTorch threadpool when executing `stmt`. Single
            threaded performance is important as both a key inference workload
            and a good indicator of intrinsic algorithmic efficiency, so the
            default is set to one. This is in contrast to the default PyTorch
            threadpool size which tries to utilize all cores.

        Note the variable `block_size` in the inner loop. The choice of block
        size is important to measurement quality, and must balance two

            1) A small block size results in more replicates and generally
               better statistics.

            2) A large block size better amortizes the cost of `timer`
               invocation, and results in a less biased measurement. This is
               important because accelerator synchronization time is non-trivial

        In order to to use this method `valgrind`, `callgrind_control`, and
        `callgrind_annotate` must be installed.

        Because there is a process boundary between the caller (this process)
        and the `stmt` execution, `globals` cannot contain arbitrary in-memory
        data structures. (Unlike timing methods) Instead, globals are
        restricted to builtins, `nn.Modules`'s, and TorchScripted functions/modules
        to reduce the surprise factor from serialization and subsequent
        deserialization. The `GlobalsBridge` class provides more detail on this
        subject. Take particular care with nn.Modules: they rely on pickle and
        you may need to add an import to `setup` for them to transfer properly.

        By default, a profile for an empty statement will be collected and
        cached to indicate how many instructions are from the Python loop which
        drives `stmt`.

        Returns:
            A `CallgrindStats` object which provides instruction counts and
            some basic facilities for analyzing and manipulating results.
