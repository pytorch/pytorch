# uuid's (e.g. different build root per _compile_template call) would lead to
# a 0% cache hit rate and spurious recompilation. Consider the following:

#   ````
# `setup` and `stmt` do not change, so we can reuse the executable from the
# first pass through the loop.

# BACK_TESTING_NOTE:
#   There are two workflows where this code could be used. One is the obvious
#   case where someone simply builds or installs PyTorch and uses Timer.
#   The other is that the entire `torch/utils/benchmark` folder from a CURRENT
#   PyTorch checkout is copy-pasted into a much OLDER version of the PyTorch
#   source code. This is what we refer to here as "back testing". The rationale
#   is that we might want to use current tooling to study some aspect of an
#   earlier version of PyTorch. (e.g. a regression.)
#
#   The problem is that Timer relies on several aspects of core PyTorch, namely
#   some binding functions for Valgrind symbols in `torch._C` and the
#   `torch.__config__._cxx_flags()` method. If we were to naively copy code
#   around this wouldn't work as the symbols of interest aren't present in
#   earlier versions of PyTorch. In order to work around this, we must add back
#   testing shims. These shims will never activate during normal use, but will
#   allow Timer to function outside of the "correct" version of PyTorch by
#   emulating functionality that was added later.
#
#   These shims are temporary, and as Timer becomes more integrated with
#   PyTorch the cost and complexity of such shims will increase. Once back
#   testing is no longer required (which is to say we have done enough historic
#   analysis and the shims no longer justify their maintenance and code
#   complexity costs) back testing paths will be removed.
