class ThroughputBenchmark:
    """
    This class is a wrapper around a c++ component throughput_benchmark::ThroughputBenchmark.

    This wrapper on the throughput_benchmark::ThroughputBenchmark component is responsible
    for executing a PyTorch module (nn.Module or ScriptModule) under an inference
    server like load. It can emulate multiple calling threads to a single module
    provided. In the future we plan to enhance this component to support inter and
    intra-op parallelism as well as multiple models running in a single process.

    Please note that even though nn.Module is supported, it might incur an overhead
    from the need to hold GIL every time we execute Python code or pass around
    inputs as Python objects. As soon as you have a ScriptModule version of your
    model for inference deployment it is better to switch to using it in this
    benchmark.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
        >>> from torch.utils import ThroughputBenchmark
        >>> bench = ThroughputBenchmark(my_module)
        >>> # Pre-populate benchmark's data set with the inputs
        >>> for input in inputs:
        ...     # Both args and kwargs work, same as any PyTorch Module / ScriptModule
        ...     bench.add_input(input[0], x2=input[1])
        >>> # Inputs supplied above are randomly used during the execution
        >>> stats = bench.benchmark(
        ...     num_calling_threads=4,
        ...     num_warmup_iters = 100,
        ...     num_iters = 1000,
