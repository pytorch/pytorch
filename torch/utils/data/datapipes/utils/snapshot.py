# TODO: Caveats
#   1. Caller (either the ReadingService or DataLoader) must pass in the initial RNG
#   2. `in_batch_shuffle` and `bucketbatch` are not compatible with this because they currently
#      lack the option to `set_seed`.

    datapipe: IterDataPipe, n_iterations: int, rng=None
) -> None:
    r"""
    Fast-forward the given DataPipe and its parents by ``n_iterations``, re-doing computations to restore a snapshot.

    For instance, applying this function to the final DataPipe of a graph will restore the snapshot
    (via fast-forward) every DataPipe within the graph.

    After you deserialize a DataPipe, you can use its `_number_of_samples_yielded` attribute as the input
    to this function to forward the DataPipe.

    A DataPipe cannot be restored twice in a row unless there is an iteration started between the restoration
    attempts.

    Note:
        This is the simplest but least efficient way to fast-forward a DataPipe. Usage of other fast-forwarding
        methods (custom ones if necessary) are recommended.

    Args:
        datapipe: IterDataPipe to be fast-forwarded
        n_iterations: number of iterations to fast-forward
        rng: ``Optional[torch.Generator]``. If not ``None``, this RNG will be used for shuffling. The generator
            should be in its `initial` state as it was first passed into ``DataLoader`` or ``ReadingService``.
