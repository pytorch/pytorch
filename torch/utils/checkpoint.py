    r"""Checkpoint a model or part of the model.

    Activation checkpointing is a technique that trades compute for memory.
    Instead of keeping tensors needed for backward alive until they are used in
    gradient computation during backward, forward computation in checkpointed
    regions omits saving tensors for backward and recomputes them during the
    backward pass. Activation checkpointing can be applied to any part of a
    model.

    There are currently two checkpointing implementations available, determined
    by the :attr:`use_reentrant` parameter. It is recommended that you use
    ``use_reentrant=False``. Please refer the note below for a discussion of
    their differences.

    .. warning::

        If the :attr:`function` invocation during the backward pass differs
        from the forward pass, e.g., due to a global variable, the checkpointed
        version may not be equivalent, potentially causing an
        error being raised or leading to silently incorrect gradients.

    .. warning::

        The ``use_reentrant`` parameter should be passed explicitly. In version
        2.4 we will raise an exception if ``use_reentrant`` is not passed.
        If you are using the ``use_reentrant=True`` variant, please refer to the
        note below for important considerations and potential limitations.

    .. note::

        The reentrant variant of checkpoint (``use_reentrant=True``) and
        the non-reentrant variant of checkpoint (``use_reentrant=False``)
        differ in the following ways:

        * Non-reentrant checkpoint stops recomputation as soon as all needed
          intermediate activations have been recomputed. This feature is enabled
          by default, but can be disabled with :func:`set_checkpoint_early_stop`.
          Reentrant checkpoint always recomputes :attr:`function` in its
          entirety during the backward pass.

        * The reentrant variant does not record the autograd graph during the
          forward pass, as it runs with the forward pass under
          :func:`torch.no_grad`. The non-reentrant version does record the
          autograd graph, allowing one to perform backward on the graph within
          checkpointed regions.

        * The reentrant checkpoint only supports the
          :func:`torch.autograd.backward` API for the backward pass without its
          `inputs` argument, while the non-reentrant version supports all ways
          of performing the backward pass.

        * At least one input and output must have ``requires_grad=True`` for the
          reentrant variant. If this condition is unmet, the checkpointed part
          of the model will not have gradients. The non-reentrant version does
          not have this requirement.

        * The reentrant version does not consider tensors in nested structures
          (e.g., custom objects, lists, dicts, etc) as participating in
          autograd, while the non-reentrant version does.

        * The reentrant checkpoint does not support checkpointed regions with
          detached tensors from the computational graph, whereas the
          non-reentrant version does. For the reentrant variant, if the
          checkpointed segment contains tensors detached using ``detach()`` or
          with :func:`torch.no_grad`, the backward pass will raise an error.
          This is because ``checkpoint`` makes all the outputs require gradients
          and this causes issues when a tensor is defined to have no gradient in
          the model. To avoid this, detach the tensors outside of the
          ``checkpoint`` function.

    Args:
        function: describes what to run in the forward pass of the model or
            part of the model. It should also know how to handle the inputs
            passed as the tuple. For example, in LSTM, if user passes
            ``(activation, hidden)``, :attr:`function` should correctly use the
            first input as ``activation`` and the second input as ``hidden``
        preserve_rng_state(bool, optional):  Omit stashing and restoring
            the RNG state during each checkpoint. Note that under torch.compile,
            this flag doesn't take effect and we always preserve RNG state.
            Default: ``True``
        use_reentrant(bool):
            specify whether to use the activation checkpoint variant that
            requires reentrant autograd. This parameter should be passed
            explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if
            ``use_reentrant`` is not passed. If ``use_reentrant=False``,
            ``checkpoint`` will use an implementation that does not require
            reentrant autograd. This allows ``checkpoint`` to support additional
            functionality, such as working as expected with
            ``torch.autograd.grad`` and support for keyword arguments input into
            the checkpointed function.
        context_fn(Callable, optional): A callable returning a tuple of two
            context managers. The function and its recomputation will be run
            under the first and second context managers respectively.
            This argument is only supported if ``use_reentrant=False``.
        determinism_check(str, optional): A string specifying the determinism
            check to perform. By default it is set to ``"default"`` which
            compares the shapes, dtypes, and devices of the recomputed tensors
            against those the saved tensors. To turn off this check, specify
            ``"none"``. Currently these are the only two supported values.
            Please open an issue if you would like to see more determinism
            checks. This argument is only supported if ``use_reentrant=False``,
            if ``use_reentrant=True``, the determinism check is always disabled.
        debug(bool, optional): If ``True``, error messages will also include
            a trace of the operators ran during the original forward computation
            as well as the recomputation. This argument is only supported if
            ``use_reentrant=False``.

    and checkpoint each segment. All segments except the last will not store
    the intermediate activations. The inputs of each checkpointed segment will
    be saved for re-running the segment in the backward pass.

    .. warning::
        The ``use_reentrant`` parameter should be passed explicitly. In version
        2.4 we will raise an exception if ``use_reentrant`` is not passed.
        If you are using the ``use_reentrant=True` variant, please see
        :func:`~torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint` for
        the important considerations and limitations of this variant. It is
        recommended that you use ``use_reentrant=False``.

    .. warning:
        Since PyTorch 1.4, it allows only one Tensor as the input and
        intermediate outputs, just like :class:`torch.nn.Sequential`.

    Args:
        functions: A :class:`torch.nn.Sequential` or the list of modules or
            functions (comprising the model) to run sequentially.
        segments: Number of chunks to create in the model
        input: A Tensor that is input to :attr:`functions`
        preserve_rng_state(bool, optional):  Omit stashing and restoring
            the RNG state during each checkpoint.
            Default: ``True``
        use_reentrant(bool):
            specify whether to use the activation checkpoint variant that
            requires reentrant autograd. This parameter should be passed
            explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if
            ``use_reentrant`` is not passed. If ``use_reentrant=False``,
            ``checkpoint`` will use an implementation that does not require
            reentrant autograd. This allows ``checkpoint`` to support additional
            functionality, such as working as expected with
            ``torch.autograd.grad`` and support for keyword arguments input into
            the checkpointed function.

    Returns:
        Output of running :attr:`functions` sequentially on :attr:`*inputs`

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("stub")
        >>> model = nn.Sequential(...)
        >>> input_var = checkpoint_sequential(model, chunks, input_var)

# NOTE [ Nestable Checkpoint ]
#
# The semantics of nested checkpoint can be defined by two basic rules.
# Following the two rules leads to an important implication that is central
# to motivating the design.
#
# Rule 1. Saved tensors are managed by inner-most checkpoint only and hidden
#         from any outer layers of checkpoint.
#
# Rule 2. The inputs of inner checkpoints are treated as tensors saved to its
#         parent checkpoint.
#
# Implication: To recompute any given saved tensor, we need to recompute all of
#              the checkpoints wrapping it.
#
# Why is this implied? To unpack a saved tensor X during backward we need to
# recompute the inner-most checkpoint (#1), and in order to recompute that
# checkpoint I need to have its inputs, which are managed by that checkpoint's
# parent (#2), which thus also needs to be recomputed first. Continue this line
# of reasoning and we realize that in order to unpack X, all checkpoints that
# were active at the time X was saved need to be recomputed. (unless we have
# already done so in that backward for some other saved tensor).
#
# In practice, we use a noop autograd Function to save inputs as saved tensors.
# During unpack calling ctx.saved_tensor triggers the parent checkpoint to
# recompute.
#
# Rule 3. We should start recomputation as if there are no checkpoints currently
#         active. Checkpoints encountered during recomputation are still
#         respected.
#
# When we start recomputation, we push the saved variable hook meant for
# recomputation on the stack. See examples in Rule 6 for more context.
#
#                                  * * * *
#
# Beyond the basic semantics specific to nested checkpoint, we impose several
# more constraints that may apply to checkpointing in general.
#
# Rule 4. Lifetime of recomputed tensors
#
#         Recomputed tensors are considered specific to particular invocations
#         of backward and are always cleared immediately as they are unpacked
#         Particularly, we require this to happen even if retain_graph=True.
#
# [ Implementation details of Rule 4 ]
#
# If we were okay with recomputed tensors staying alive after backward is run
# with retain_graph=True, we would store recomputed variables as the values of a
# WeakKeyDictionary and pack strong references to the keys, so that as we
# backward, those packed keys would be cleared as long as retain_graph=False.
# Clearing the packed key clears the corresponding entry in the WKD.
#
# If we wish recomputed variables to be immediately cleared as we unpack them in
# the retain_graph=True case, we cannot rely on the packed keys to be cleared by
# backward automatically. Instead of packing the strong reference to the key
# directly, we pack a container object, which we manually clear as we unpack.
#
# An important detail is that if a second backward happens, the second
# recomputation needs to reset the container with a newly created key.
#
# Rule 5. Stop recomputation as soon as we've recomputed the saved tensors we
#         know we need.
#
# [ Implementation details of Rule 5 ]
#
# During recomputation, raise an exception if the number of recomputed tensors
# matches the number of tensors that we expected to recompute. We wrap the
# recomputation call with a try-catch to catch this specific exception. See
# Rule #6 below for some examples.
#
# Rule 6. We support doing backward inside checkpoint context
#
# [ retain_graph is True]
#
# def fn(x):
#   y = x.sin()
#   z = y.cos()
#   gx, = torch.autograd.grad(z, x, retains_grad=True)
#   return gx, z
#
# out = checkpoint(fn)(inp)
# out.backward()
#
# Because z is saved by cos while checkpoint is enabled, it would not be
# actually saved, and so the .grad() call inside must trigger a recomputation.
#
# During recomputation the "inner pack hook" has two responsibilities:
#
# 1) As usual, populating the WeakKeyDictionary storing recomputed tensors
# 2) Pack the actual tensor (detached) so that one may perform backward on the
#    recomputed graph. The tensors saved to this graph will live until the end
#    of recomputation, or die earlier if someone performs backward with
#    retain_graph=False.
#
# More generally performing backward on the recomputed graph occurs in the
# following cases:
# - If backward is performed inside forward,
#   - During the original forward IF early-stop is disabled
#   - During the original backward
# - If there are multiple .grad()/.backward() calls, we would perform backward
#   on the recomputed graph even if early-stop is enabled (see the example below)
#
# [ retain_graph is False ]
#
# The example below shows what happens if during recomputation we find that some
# of the tensors we are trying to recompute have already been cleared.
#
# Spoiler: we don't do anything special, we just skip over them!
#
# def fn(x):
#   y = x.sin()                           # (1)
#   z = y.cos()                           # (2)
#   gx, = torch.autograd.grad(z, x)       # (3)
#   return x.cos() * gx                   # (4)
#
# out = checkpoint(fn)(inp)
# out.backward()                          # (5)
#
# 1, 2. Don't save x and y since we are inside a checkpoint.
# 3. Trigger a recompute of fn since x and y weren't saved.
#    And depending on whether early stop is enabled, either stop at (2) or
#    continue running the function.
#    Because we are running backward with retain_graph=False, we clear x and y's
#    holders.
# 4. Don't save x since we are inside a checkpoint.
# 5. Calling backward triggers another recompute of fn. During recompute, we see
#    that x and y have already been cleared in the original graph as indicated
#    by holder=None. We skip over them. We still save x at (4) (since its holder
#    is still alive.)
