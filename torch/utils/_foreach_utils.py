# This util function splits tensors into groups by device and dtype, which is useful before sending
# tensors off to a foreach implementation, which requires tensors to be on one device and dtype.
# If tensorlistlist contains more than one tensorlist, the following assumptions are made BUT NOT verified:
#   - tensorlists CAN be None
#   - all tensors in the first specified list cannot be None
#   - given an index i, all specified tensorlist[i]s match in dtype and device
# with_indices (bool, optional): whether to track previous indices as the last list per dictionary entry.
#   It comes in handy if there are Nones or literals in the tensorlists that are getting scattered out.
#   Whereas mutating a tensor in the resulting split-up tensorlists WILL propagate changes back to the
#   original input tensorlists, changing up Nones/literals WILL NOT propagate, and manual propagation
#   may be necessary. Check out torch/optim/sgd.py for an example.
