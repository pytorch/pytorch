"""
This module provides the public comptime interface to TorchDynamo, enabling users to execute
arbitrary Python code during symbolic evaluation of their programs.

The comptime interface allows inspection and modification of TorchDynamo's compilation
process while it is running. This can be useful for:

- Debugging compilation issues
- Inspecting intermediate state
- Adding custom guards or graph breaks
- Analyzing symbolic shapes and values

Example usage:

    import torch
    from torch._dynamo.comptime import comptime

    def my_model(x):
        # Print the compile-time known information about x
        comptime.print(x)

        # Print the current FX graph being constructed
        comptime.print_graph()

        # Force a value to be treated as static
        if comptime(lambda ctx: ctx.get_local("x").is_dynamic()):
            comptime.force_static(x)

        # Add a manual graph break
        comptime.graph_break()

Note: While this API provides significant flexibility, it intentionally avoids
exposing internal implementation details of TorchDynamo to maintain compatibility
across versions.
