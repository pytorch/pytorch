"""
Ahead-of-time precompilation of a callable into MANY graphs: the multi-graph
counterpart of ``torch.compile(fn, fullgraph=True).aot_compile(...)``. Every
frame Dynamo produces while the caller's calls run -- the entry
frame, each ``torch_dynamo_resume_in_*`` continuation created by a graph break,
and every recompiled variant of each -- is captured into one serializable
artifact on top of CompilePackage.

Everything here is internal; the session that drives it and the
``torch.compiler.precompile.capture(..., tracer=DynamoTracer())`` entry point build on
these in later commits. This is distinct from
``torch._dynamo.config.caching_precompile``, which caches ``torch.compile``
artifacts transparently without an explicit capture.

Capture is by execution, and the caller drives it: the session hands back a
callable, the caller invokes it with real inputs inside their own loop, and
every frame Dynamo produces is recorded. Runtime guards stay intact during
capture; ``guard_filter_fn`` applies only to the serialized copy, and every
dropped guard is reported in ``PrecompileSummary.dropped_guards``.

    with torch.compiler.precompile.capture(
        step, artifact_path="m.py", cache_path="m.cache", backend="inductor"
    ) as cap:
        y1 = cap(model, x1)  # runs step(model, x1), returns its result
        y2 = cap(model, x2)  # exercises another variant

    # later, in a fresh process
    compiled = torch.compiler.precompile.load("m.py", "m.cache")
    with compiled, torch.no_grad():
        compiled(model, x1)

The caller's calls ARE the capture: each ``cap(...)`` runs the callable for
real, returns its result, and records every frame, break continuation and
guarded variant it exercises. ``precompile.accumulate`` is the same model, rewriting the artifact on every
call instead of once at block exit.

Calls run with the grad mode the caller sets -- capture does not force
``no_grad()`` or ``enable_grad()``. ``training=True`` lowers the backward
eagerly so the artifact carries one and a served output can be backpropagated.
No loss is needed for that: the joint trace synthesizes tangents from the
forward outputs' own metadata.

Live capture retains every runtime guard, so later examples trigger the same
recompilations as ordinary ``torch.compile``. ``guard_filter_fn`` applies only
to the serialized copy. If serialization drops a configuration-dependent guard,
the artifact is refused by default rather than written with variants whose
dispatch would be ambiguous after load. ``invariants`` writes a readable report
that separates, per frame, the guards holding in EVERY variant from the ones
that differed: the first are preconditions the artifact is only valid under,
the second are what tell its graphs apart. Guards from different frames are not
comparable -- an entry frame guards its arguments, a resume frame guards
whatever crossed the break -- so the intersection is per frame.

Capture is by execution: a resume function only exists once the frame ahead of
it has actually run, so every variant must be exercised. Whatever you do not
run is not in the artifact, and ``summary().complete`` means complete only for
the observed capture, not for every possible input to the callable. A captured
call that raises marks the session incomplete even if caller code catches it.

Know these before relying on an artifact in production:

* An inference artifact is the default: the caller runs the calls under
  ``torch.no_grad()``. For a training artifact pass ``training=True``, which
  traces with grad on and lowers the backward eagerly -- without it, AOTAutograd
  defers the backward to the first ``.backward()`` call, so a grad-enabled
  capture that never makes one records no backends and cannot be written.
* A non-tensor argument, and any value that crosses a graph break, is guarded
  by equality, so an int/bool/str argument or a break coming from ``.item()``
  yields an artifact that only serves calls reproducing those exact values.
  ``summary().wont_generalize`` lists them; exercise every value you need to
  serve with a ``cap(...)`` call, or expect poor coverage on new data.
  ``dynamic=True`` helps with shapes but not with pinned values.
* Identity guards cannot be serialized, so precompiling gives up on noticing
  that a guarded object was rebound. ``summary().dropped_guards`` is the
  authoritative list. ``risky_dropped_guards`` includes every drop observed to
  distinguish captured variants plus a lint for configuration-like sources; it
  is still not a proof for unobserved deployments. See ``_is_risky_drop``. The
  public ``torch.compiler.precompile`` facade rejects the RISKY subset by
  default. Refusing every drop is opt-in: every model drops the identity guards
  precompile cannot serialize, so ``require_no_dropped_guards=True`` refuses
  essentially every real artifact. Some models trip the lint on
  library internals: measured on stock models, torchvision resnet18 and
  mobilenet_v3 report none, timm's ViT reports one (a re-exported
  ``torch._assert``) and transformers' Qwen2 reports 33 built from a two-layer
  config, 55 for the pretrained 24-layer, of which only the
  attention-implementation registry looks genuinely config-selected. Report
  counts are per model, not per library: torchvision's efficientnet_b0 reports
  2 and timm's swin reports 5, one of which is a real config slot. Audit the
  list before relying on the relaxed dropped-guard default, and before
  relaxing the risky-drop rail on top of it.
* Some models do not capture yet. For example, T5 raises ``PackageError: Cannot
  find module for code <code object __init__`` from ``_get_code_source``, which
  is byte-identical to base and which plain ``caching_precompile`` also raises.
* The model must live in an importable module. Source is checksummed, so a
  class defined in ``__main__`` or a REPL cannot be loaded elsewhere.
* ``install()`` writes compiled and resume functions into module globals, but
  guarded dispatch is scoped to the isolated compile region owned by the
  returned callable. Call the returned object rather than another instance of
  the same class. Multiple loaded artifacts can share entry, inner, and resume
  code objects without taking each other's entries; ``unload()`` removes only
  its own region and the globals it still owns.

This wraps CompilePackage, which is the low-level component and is not meant to
be used directly.

The public surface is ``torch.compiler.precompile.capture(...)``, a caller-driven
capture used as a context manager: the caller's own calls inside the block drive
the capture, and the ``(python_code, cache)`` artifact is written to the given files
when the block exits (its default ``tracer=DynamoTracer()`` records many calls;
``tracer=MakeFxTracer()`` produces a self-contained Python source artifact from one
call); ``torch.compiler.precompile.accumulate(...)``, the counterpart that rewrites
the files after every call; and ``torch.compiler.precompile.load``.
The helpers in this module, including the capture session, implement that surface
and remain internal. All of it is distinct from ``torch._dynamo.config.caching_precompile``,
which caches ``torch.compile`` artifacts transparently without an explicit
capture block.
