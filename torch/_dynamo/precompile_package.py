"""
Ahead-of-time precompilation of a callable into MANY graphs: the multi-graph
counterpart of ``torch.compile(fn, fullgraph=True).aot_compile(...)``. Every
frame Dynamo produces while the caller's calls run -- the entry frame, each
``torch_dynamo_resume_in_*`` continuation created by a graph break, and every
recompiled variant of each -- is captured into one serializable artifact whose
frames are stored through CompilePackage (``torch/_dynamo/package.py``), a
low-level component that is not meant to be used directly.

Everything here is internal, and the module fills in over several commits: the
guard filter the serialized copy is written under (``default_guard_filter_fn``)
comes first, then the lint over the guards it drops (``_is_risky_drop``), the
guard-type classification and fingerprints behind the ``PrecompileSummary``
report, the per-frame comparison of captured variants and the summary builder
(``_varying_guard_slots``, ``_summarize``), and the compiler configuration a
capture runs under (``_capture_config``). The capture session that calls them
-- the ``torch.compiler.precompile.capture`` / ``accumulate`` / ``load`` entry
points, its ``guard_filter_fn`` and ``require_no_dropped_guards`` options and
the runnable ``load`` returns -- is a follow-up, so until it lands nothing
under ``torch/`` calls into this module; the module docstring of
``torch/_precompile.py``, rewritten at the top of this stack, carries the
caller-facing usage. This is distinct from
``torch._dynamo.config.caching_precompile``, which caches ``torch.compile``
artifacts transparently without an explicit capture.

Capture is by execution, and the caller drives it: the session hands back a
callable, the caller invokes it with real inputs inside their own loop, and
every frame Dynamo produces is recorded. Runtime guards stay intact during
capture, so later calls trigger the same recompilations as ordinary
``torch.compile``: the session's ``guard_filter_fn`` applies only to the
serialized copy, unlike ``torch.compile``'s option of the same name, which
removes a rejected guard from the runtime check as well
(``CheckFunctionManager.__init__`` builds the runtime guards from the filtered
list). Every dropped guard is reported in ``PrecompileSummary.dropped_guards``.

If serialization drops a configuration-dependent guard, the artifact is refused
by default rather than written with variants whose dispatch would be ambiguous
after load. Which drops those are is decided per frame, by comparing the guards
of every captured variant of one frame: a guard that held identically in every
variant is a precondition the artifact is only valid under, one that differed
is what tells its graphs apart. Guards from different frames are not
comparable -- an entry frame guards its arguments, a resume frame guards
whatever crossed the break -- so the comparison never crosses frames.

Because capture is by execution, a resume function only exists once the frame
ahead of it has actually run, so every variant must be exercised. Whatever you
do not run is not in the artifact, and ``PrecompileSummary.complete`` means
complete only for the observed capture, not for every possible input to the
callable. A captured call that raises marks the session incomplete even if
caller code catches it.

Know these before relying on an artifact in production:

* Calls run with the grad mode the caller sets; capture forces neither
  ``no_grad()`` nor ``enable_grad()``. For an inference artifact run the calls
  under ``torch.no_grad()``. For a training artifact capture with
  ``training=True`` (see ``_capture_config``), which lowers the backward
  eagerly so the artifact carries one and a served output can be
  backpropagated -- without it, AOTAutograd defers the backward to the first
  ``.backward()`` call, so a grad-enabled capture that never makes one records
  no backends and cannot be written. No loss is needed: the joint trace
  synthesizes tangents from the forward outputs' own metadata.
* A non-tensor argument, and any value that crosses a graph break, is guarded
  by equality, so an int/bool/str argument or a break coming from ``.item()``
  yields an artifact that only serves calls reproducing those exact values.
  ``PrecompileSummary.wont_generalize`` lists them; exercise every value you
  need to serve with a captured call, or expect poor coverage on new data.
  ``dynamic=True`` helps with shapes but not with pinned values.
* Identity guards (and the dict-version and weakref-liveness guards) cannot be
  serialized, so precompiling gives up on noticing that a guarded object was
  rebound, mutated or collected. ``PrecompileSummary.dropped_guards`` is the
  authoritative list. ``PrecompileSummary.risky_dropped_guards`` includes
  every drop observed to distinguish captured variants plus a lint for
  configuration-like sources (``_is_risky_drop``); it is still not a proof for
  unobserved deployments. The follow-up's public ``torch.compiler.precompile``
  facade rejects the RISKY subset by default. Refusing every drop is opt-in: every
  model drops the identity guards precompile cannot serialize, so
  ``require_no_dropped_guards=True`` refuses essentially every real artifact.
  Some models trip the lint on library internals. Measured on stock models
  when this was written, torchvision resnet18 and mobilenet_v3 report none,
  timm's ViT reports one (a re-exported ``torch._assert``) and transformers'
  Qwen2 reports 33 built from a two-layer config, 55 for the pretrained
  24-layer, of which only the attention-implementation registry looks genuinely
  config-selected. Report counts are per model, not per library: torchvision's
  efficientnet_b0 reports 2 and timm's swin reports 5, one of which is a real
  config slot. Audit the list before relying on the relaxed dropped-guard
  default, and before relaxing the risky-drop rail on top of it.
* Some models do not capture yet. For example, T5 raises ``PackageError: Cannot
  find module for code <code object __init__`` from ``_get_code_source`` in
  ``torch/_dynamo/package.py``, which plain ``caching_precompile`` also raises.
* The model must live in an importable module. Source is checksummed, so a
  class defined in ``__main__`` or a REPL cannot be loaded elsewhere.
* ``CompilePackage.install()`` writes compiled and resume functions into module
  globals, but guarded dispatch is scoped to the isolated compile region owned
  by the runnable ``load`` returns. Call that runnable rather than another
  instance of the same class. Multiple loaded artifacts can share entry, inner,
  and resume code objects without taking each other's entries; the runnable's
  ``unload()`` removes only its own region and the globals it still owns.

    Drop every guard whose type, or whose derived type, is one the serializer
    refuses, and keep everything else.

    Read this before trusting an artifact. The refused set is the IDENTITY
    guards -- ID_MATCH, FUNCTION_MATCH, CLOSURE_MATCH, MODULE_MATCH, NN_MODULE,
    CLASS_MATCH -- plus DICT_VERSION (dict mutation) and WEAKREF_ALIVE
    (liveness), so precompiling inherently gives up on noticing that a guarded
    object was REBOUND to a different object of the same shape, MUTATED or
    COLLECTED. Most such guards are on modules and builtins and are stable
    in practice, but one on a global holding a function is not: rebind it
    between capture and load and the artifact serves the graph traced against
    the old one, with no error. Keeping them instead makes serialization raise
    for essentially every function, so every drop is recorded with its source
    name in ``PrecompileSummary.dropped_guards`` and the only rail on by default
    is the module's risky-drop lint over them; a lint is not a proof.

    This is not exactly ``CheckFunctionManager.serialize_guards``'s test. It is
    stricter in one direction: ``GuardBuilder.BUILTIN_MATCH`` is an
    ``id_match_unchecked`` that records ID_MATCH as its derived type, so this
    drops EVERY builtin guard (``len``, ``isinstance``, ``torch.relu`` and the
    like) although the serializer accepts a TYPE_MATCH or BUILTIN_MATCH whatever
    its derived types; a builtin rebound between capture and load is therefore
    never detected either. It is looser in the other: a TYPE_MATCH on a
    local-scope class passes here and the serializer still refuses it, because
    the type cannot be pickled. ``CheckFunctionManager.__init__`` applies the
    same idea inline under ``torch._dynamo.config.caching_precompile`` (drop
    ID_MATCH, CLOSURE_MATCH, WEAKREF_ALIVE, DICT_VERSION and anything deriving
    ID_MATCH or DICT_VERSION); this set is the serializer's full refusal list,
