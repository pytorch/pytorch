    This defines a join hook, which provides two entry points in the join context manager.

    Entry points : a main hook, which is called repeatedly while there exists a non-joined
    process, and a post-hook, which is called once all processes have joined.

    To implement a join hook for the generic join context manager, define a
    class that inherits from :class:`JoinHook` and override ``main_hook()`` and
    ``post_hook()`` as appropriate.

class Join:
    r"""
    This class defines the generic join context manager, which allows custom hooks to be called after a process joins.

    These hooks should shadow the
    collective communications of non-joined processes to prevent hanging and
    erroring and to ensure algorithmic correctness. Refer to :class:`JoinHook`
    for details about the hook definition.

    .. warning::
        The context manager requires each participating :class:`Joinable` to
        call the method :meth:`notify_join_context()` before its own per-
        iteration collective communications to ensure correctness.

    .. warning::
        The context manager requires that all ``process_group`` attributes in
        the :class:`JoinHook` objects are the same. If there are multiple
        :class:`JoinHook` objects, then the ``device`` of the first is used.
        The process group and device information is used for checking for non-
        joined processes and for notifying processes to throw an exception if
        ``throw_on_early_termination`` is enabled, both of which using an all-
        reduce.

    Arguments:
        joinables (List[Joinable]): a list of the participating
            :class:`Joinable` s; their hooks are iterated over in the given
            order.

        enable (bool): a flag enabling uneven input detection; setting to
            ``False`` disables the context manager's functionality and should
            only be set when the user knows the inputs will not be uneven
            (default: ``True``).

        throw_on_early_termination (bool): a flag controlling whether to throw an
            exception upon detecting uneven inputs (default: ``False``).

    Example::

        >>> import os
        >>> import torch
        >>> import torch.distributed as dist
        >>> import torch.multiprocessing as mp
