    Utility class for representing an integer layout by borrowing ideas from CuTe Layout Algebra.
    See https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/cute/02_layout_algebra.html for more details.

    Each layout is represented as a list of sizes and strides. We use it as a way for mechanical bookkeeping
    of the integers such as ranks in a SPMD mesh, and the transformation on top of it.

    Lots of methods of layout like coalesce, composition, complement, etc. are borrowed from pycute.

    Note this is a CuTe-inspired layout, because CuTe uses co-lexicographic way in linearization while PyTorch
    is using lexicographic. So even though the CuTe documentation can still be referenced, the implementation will be
    different from that of PyCute's.

        Mental model about how to understand the composition logic:
        - The LEFT layout (self) defines the "output space" - what indices are possible
        - The RIGHT layout (layout parameter) acts as a "selector" - which specific indices to pick
        - The composition only generates indices that the left layout could originally produce,
          but the right layout determines which indices to be picked.
        - The stride of the composition layout will not be smaller than the stride of the right layout,
          because when picking the indices the composition will at least follow the the right layout's stride
          to move forward.

        Example:

        A complement layout fills in the "missing" factor so that: self repeat a layout of complement(self, world_size)

        Example:
          self = (4:1)   # size=4, stride=1
          world_size = 8
          Then:
