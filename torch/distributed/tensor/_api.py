# NOTE [Autograd interaction between torch.Tensor]
#
# The autograd functions defined below are being used by the public
# facing APIs (i.e. from_local, to_local) to ensure DTensor to work
# together with torch.Tensor within the autograd engine. This
# allows DTensor to only exist on part of the module hierarchy.
#
# As an example, we have the a module that consists of submodules
# A, B, and C, the execution flow would be like:
#  input(torch.Tensor) -> Module A -> Module B -> Module C -> output (torch.Tensor)
#
# Suppose I only want to make Module B be a sharded module with
# DTensor params, the following forward/backward should work:
#
#  input(torch.Tensor) -> Module A
#       -> DTensor input (from_local) -> Sharded Module B -> DTensor output
#           -> torch.Tensor output (to_local) -> Module C
#
# So from_local/to_local must be Autograd functions.

    """
    This function places `placements` and `shard_order` in a redundant but
    canonical form, whereas in the input users can elide redundant information
    when specifying `placements`. For example, when there is never a tensor
    dimension that is sharded by multiple mesh dims, `shard_order` can be elided
    (this is traditional "PyTorch" style). Similarly, if a user specifies a
    `shard_order` that has entry for every device mesh dim, the `placements` can
    be inferred (this is traditional "JAX" style).

    You can also specify both arguments, which may be necessary in some
    situations as `placements` and `shard_order` have different expressivity.
    For example, to express that a device mesh is `Partial` or a non-standard
    sharding differently from Shard, you must use `placements` (as only it takes
    Placement). To express the order multiple shardings apply to a single tensor
    dimension, you must use `shard_order`. If you want to express both of these
    things, you will need to use both arguments.

    `placements` and `shard_order` must be consistent with each other. What this
    means is, when both are set, for each entry on `shard_order` i.e.,
    tensor_dim: mesh_dim, it must be the case that `Shard(tensor_dim)[...,
    mesh_dim, ...]` corresponds to a `placements[mesh_dim]` with the value
    `Shard(tensor_dim)`. For every entry on `placements`, if
    `placements[mesh_dim]` value is `Shard(tensor_dim)`, it must be the case
    either `shard_order` is None (no shard order was specified for `placements`,
    default ordering is fine) or `mesh_dim` in `shard_order[tensor_dim]` (it is
    not OK to omit mesh dims from an explicitly specified placement). A mesh dim
    mentioned in `shard_order` is always a Shard placement, no other placement
    types are supported.

    In the returned canonical representation, no information is omitted. In
    particular, `shard_order` is no longer a dict, it is a sparse tuple with
    each inner tuple corresponds to a tensor dimension as the first element and
    remaining elements as the indices of device mesh dimensions that this tensor
    dimension is sharded over. Check the "Returns" section for more details.

    Args:
        device_mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`): DeviceMesh to place the tensor.
        tensor_rank (int): The rank (number of dimensions) of the tensor to be
            distributed or redistributed.
        placements (Sequence[:class:`Placement`], optional): The placements that
            describe how to place the local torch.Tensor on DeviceMesh. Must
            have the same number of elements as ``device_mesh.ndim``.
        shard_order ([Dict[int, Sequence[int | str]]], optional):
            Specifies the mapping of tensor dimensions to the order of device mesh
            dimensions they are sharded over. Each key is a tensor dimension (can be
            negative for reverse indexing), and its value is a list specifying the
            device mesh dimensions (as integers or strings) that the tensor
            dimension is sharded across, in order. If not specified, a default
            left-to-right on the device mesh sharding order is used.

    Returns:
        Tuple:
            - placements (Tuple[:class:`Placement`, ...]): The computed
                placements as a tuple.
            - shard_order (Tuple[Tuple[int, ...], ...]): The computed shard
                order as a tuple of tuples. Each inner tuple corresponds to a
                tensor dimension and contains the indices of device mesh
                dimensions that this tensor dimension is sharded over, in order.
                For example, shard_order[0] = (2, 1, 2) means tensor dimension 2
                is sharded first over mesh dimension 1, then mesh dimension 2. The
                first element of each inner tuple is the tensor dimension, and the
                remaining elements are the ordered device mesh dimensions. If a
                tensor dimension is not sharded, its tuple will be empty.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the length of `placements` does not match
            `device_mesh.ndim`, if `shard_order` contains invalid tensor or
            mesh dimensions, if both normalized and un-normalized tensor_dim
            are specified in `shard_order`, or if a tensor_dim or mesh_dim in
            `shard_order` is out of range.
        RuntimeError: If attempting to redistribute from a non-Partial to a
            Partial placement, from one Partial type to a different Partial type,
            or use _StridedShard with `shard_order`.
        AssertionError: If a placement's shard dim normalization would result in
            a negative value, or if there is a conflict between placements and
            shard_order for sharding annotation.

    * :class:`Replicate`: Tensor replicated on the devices of the ``DeviceMesh`` dimension
    * :class:`Partial`: Tensor is pending reduction on the devices of the ``DeviceMesh`` dimension

    When calling PyTorch operators, ``DTensor`` overrides the PyTorch operators to perform sharded computation and issue
    communications whenever necessary. Along with the operator computation, ``DTensor`` will transform or propagate the
    placements (DTensor Layout) properly (based on the operator semantic itself) and generate new ``DTensor`` outputs.

    To ensure numerical correctness of the ``DTensor`` sharded computation when calling PyTorch operators, ``DTensor``
    requires every Tensor argument of the operator be DTensor.

    .. note:: Directly using the Tensor subclass constructor here is not the recommended way to create a ``DTensor``
        (i.e. it does not handle autograd correctly hence is not the public API). Please refer to the `create_dtensor`_
        section to see how to create a ``DTensor``.

        When a tensor dimension is sharded across multiple mesh axes,
        `shard_order` specifies the sequence in which these shardings are
        applied. This order determines how tensor shards are mapped and
        distributed across devices. `shard_order` is a tuple of tuples of
        integers: in each inner tuple, the first element is the tensor dimension
        being sharded, and the remaining elements are the device mesh dimensions
        (in order) over which that tensor dimension is sharded.

        Example:
            For a tensor of shape [8, 16] and a 3D device mesh, if dim 0 is
            sharded over mesh dim 1, and dim 1 is sharded over mesh dim 0 and
            then mesh dim 2, the shard_order would be: shard_order = ((0, 1),

    Distribute a leaf ``torch.Tensor`` (i.e. nn.Parameter/buffers) to the ``device_mesh`` according
    to the ``placements`` specified. The rank of ``device_mesh`` and ``placements`` must be the
    same. The ``tensor`` to distribute is the logical or "global" tensor, and the API would use
    the ``tensor`` from first rank of the DeviceMesh dimension as the source of truth to preserve
    the single-device semantic. If you want to construct a DTensor in the middle of the Autograd
    computation, please use :meth:`DTensor.from_local` instead.

    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): torch.Tensor to be distributed. Note that if you
            want to shard a tensor on a dimension that is not evenly divisible by
            the number of devices in that mesh dimension, we use ``torch.chunk``
            semantic to shard the tensor and scatter the shards. The uneven sharding
            behavior is experimental and subject to change.
        device_mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`, optional): DeviceMesh to distribute the
            tensor, if not specified, must be called under a DeviceMesh context
            manager, default: None
        placements (Sequence[:class:`Placement`], optional): the placements that
            describes how to place the tensor on DeviceMesh, must have the same
            number of elements as ``device_mesh.ndim``. If not specified, we will
            by default replicate the tensor across the ``device_mesh`` from the
            first rank of each dimension of the ``device_mesh``.
        shard_order (Optional[Dict[int, Sequence[int | str]]], optional): Specifies the
            mapping of tensor dimensions to the order of device mesh dimensions they
            are sharded over. Each key is a tensor dimension (can be negative for reverse
            indexing), and its value is a sequence specifying the device mesh dimensions
            (as integers or strings) that the tensor dimension is sharded across, in
            order. If not specified, a default sharding order is used.
            Example: For a 3D tensor and a 4D device mesh, to shard tensor dimension
            0 over mesh dim 1, and tensor dimension 1 over mesh dim 2 and then mesh dim 0,
            use "shard_order = {0: [1], 1: [2, 0]}". In this case, you can also specify the
            `placements` as [Shard(1), Shard(0), Shard(1), Replicate()] along with `shard_order`.

            Note: As long as there are no Partial placements (though this should
            not happen as of today), you may specify only shard_order (and not
            placements if device order is not the default left-to-right), and the
            correct placements will be inferred.

    Keyword args:
        src_data_rank (int, optional): the rank of the source data for the logical/global tensor, it is
            used by :meth:`distribute_tensor` to scatter/broadcast the shards/replicas to other ranks.
            By default, we use ``group_rank=0`` on each DeviceMesh dimension as the source data to preserve
            the single-device semantic. If passing ``None`` explicitly, :meth:`distribute_tensor` simply uses
            its local data instead of trying to preserve the single-device semantic via scatter/broadcast.
            Default: 0

    Returns:
        A :class:`DTensor` or ``XLAShardedTensor`` object.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the tensor is not a leaf tensor, if attempting to distribute Partial placements,
            or if trying to distribute a tensor with unsupported placements.
        ValueError: If a DTensor with a different device mesh or placements is provided,
            if ``placements`` has a different length than the device mesh dimensions,
            if ``shard_order`` contains invalid tensor or mesh dimensions, or if both normalized and un-normalized
            tensor_dim are specified in ``shard_order``, or if a tensor_dim in ``shard_order`` is out of range.
        IndexError: If a mesh_dim specified in ``shard_order`` is out of range for the device mesh.
        ImportError: If XLA support is requested but torch_xla package is not installed.
        AssertionError: If ``shard_order`` conflicts with ``_StridedShard`` placement type.

    .. note::
        When initialize the DeviceMesh with the ``xla`` device_type, ``distribute_tensor``
