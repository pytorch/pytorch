@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MixedPrecisionPolicy:
    r"""
    This configures FSDP's mixed precision. Parameter precision may be
    configured per parameter, while input and output casting applies at the
    module level. Unlike autocast, this is not an op-level policy.

    FSDP works well with mixed precision since it keeps the high-precision
    sharded parameters in memory anyway. In other words, FSDP does not require
    any extra memory to keep a high-precision copy of the parameters for the
    optimizer step.

    Attributes:
        param_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            the unsharded parameter and hence the dtype for forward/backward
            computation and the parameter all-gather. If this is ``None``, then
            the unsharded parameter uses the original dtype. The optimizer step
            uses the sharded parameter in the original dtype. This is also the
            default dtype used when ``param_dtype_fn`` returns ``None``.
            (Default: ``None``)
        reduce_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            gradient reduction (i.e. reduce-scatter or all-reduce). If this is
            ``None`` but ``param_dtype`` is not ``None``, then the reduction
            uses the compute dtype. This can be used to run gradient reduction
            in full precision while using low precision for compute. If also
            gradient reduction is disabled via :meth:`set_requires_gradient_sync`,
            then FSDP will accumulate gradients using ``reduce_dtype``.
            If ``param_dtype_fn`` selects multiple compute dtypes for trainable
            parameters, then this must be set to a common explicit dtype.
            (Default: ``None``)
        output_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            casting floating-point forward outputs. This can be used to
            help implement cases where different modules have different mixed
            precision policies. (Default: ``None``)
        cast_forward_inputs (bool): This specifies whether FSDP should cast the
            forward's floating-point input tensors to ``param_dtype`` or not.
            For grouped ``fully_shard([a, b, ...])``, the cast is applied per
            module, before each module's forward.
        param_dtype_fn (Callable[[nn.Parameter], Optional[torch.dtype]], optional):
            This callable overrides ``param_dtype`` for individual parameters.
            It is called once per parameter during initialization, before FSDP
            replaces the parameter. Returning ``None`` uses ``param_dtype``.
            To preserve a parameter's original dtype, return ``param.dtype``.
            The callable must return the same result on every rank. It does not
            affect forward input or output casting, which remain module-level.
            FSDP does not retain the callable after initialization. Callers
            should likewise avoid retaining original parameters through a
            long-lived callable closure.
            Default: ``None``.
