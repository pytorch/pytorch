class MixedPrecisionPolicy:
    """
    This configures FSDP's mixed precision. Unlike autocast, this applies mixed
    precision at the module level, not op level, which means low-precision
    activations are saved for backward and high-to-low-precision casts are
    incurred only at module boundaries.

    FSDP works well with module-level mixed precision since it keeps the
    high-precision sharded parameters in memory anyway. In other words, FSDP
    does not require any extra memory to keep a high-precision copy of the
    parameters for the optimizer step.

    Attributes:
        param_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            the unsharded parameter and hence the dtype for forward/backward
            computation and the parameter all-gather. If this is ``None``, then
            the unsharded parameter uses the original dtype. The optimizer step
            uses the sharded parameter in the original dtype. (Default:
            ``None``)
        reduce_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            gradient reduction (i.e. reduce-scatter or all-reduce). If this is
            ``None`` but ``param_dtype`` is not ``None``, then the reduction
            uses the compute dtype. This can be used to run gradient reduction
            in full precision while using low precision for compute. If also
            gradient reduction is disabled via :meth:`set_requires_gradient_sync`,
            then FSDP will accumulate gradients using ``reduce_dtype``.
            (Default: ``None``)
        output_dtype (Optional[torch.dtype]): This specifies the dtype for
            casting floating-point forward outputs. This can be used to
            help implement cases where different modules have different mixed
            precision policies. (Default: ``None``)
        cast_forward_inputs (bool): This specifies whether FSDP should cast the
            forward's floating-point input tensors to ``param_dtype`` or not.
            For grouped ``fully_shard([a, b, ...])``, the cast is applied per
            module, before each module's forward.

    Return these records in the inputs of ``(inputs, metadata)`` from

    using its own shape, independently of the parameter's shard dimension.
    For example, a payload of shape ``(2, F, D)`` with ``dim=1`` produces
    ``(2, world_size * F, D)``. Scalar payloads are treated as shape ``(1,)``.
    The gathered payload is optionally reshaped to ``output_size`` before
    being passed to the unchanged ``fsdp_post_all_gather`` hook.
