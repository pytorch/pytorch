Experimental staging module for PyTorch Distributed Checkpointing.
This module provides advanced staging capabilities for checkpoints including:
- Asynchronous staging using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Pinned memory allocation for faster CPU-GPU transfers
- Shared memory support for multi-process scenarios
- Non-blocking CUDA operations with stream synchronization
- Caching of frequently used storages for efficient memory management
- Automatic resource cleanup and memory management
Classes:
    AsyncStager: Protocol defining the staging interface
    StagingOptions: Configuration dataclass for staging behavior
    DefaultStager: Default implementation with comprehensive staging features
    BlockingAsyncStager: Implementation of AsyncStager which stages the state_dict

    """
    This protocol is meant to provide customization and extensibility for dcp.async_save, allowing users
    to customize how data is staged previous to executing the usual dcp.save path in parallel.
    The expected order of operations (concretely defined in `torch.distributed.state_dict_saver.async_save`)
    is the following:

    1. AsyncStager.stage_data(state_dict):
        This call gives the AsyncStager the opportunity to 'stage'
        the state_dict. The expectation and purpose of staging in this context is to create a "training-safe"
        representation of the state dict, meaning that any updates to module data after staging is complete
        should not be reflected in the state dict returned from this method. For example, in the default
        case a copy of the entire state dict is created on CPU RAM and returned here, allowing users
        to continue training without risking changes to data which is being serialized.

    2. dcp.save is called on the state_dict returned from stage in parallel. This call is responsible
        for serializing the state_dict and writing it to storage.

    3. If AsyncStager.should_synchronize_after_execute is True, this method will be called immediately after
        the serialization thread starts and before returning from dcp.async_save. If this is set to False,
        the assumption is the user has defined a custom synchronization point for the the purpose of further
        optimizing save latency in the training loop (for example, by overlapping staging with the
        forward/backward pass), and it is the respondsibility of the user to call `AsyncStager.synchronize_staging`
        at the appropriate time.

class DefaultStager(AsyncStager):
    """
    DefaultStager provides a full-featured staging implementation that combines
    multiple optimization techniques for efficient checkpoint preparation.

    The staging process works as follows:
    1. State dictionary is submitted for staging (sync or async)
    2. Tensors are copied from GPU to optimized CPU storage
    3. CUDA operations are synchronized if non-blocking copies are used
    4. Staged state dictionary is returned or made available via Future

    Usage Patterns:
        # Synchronous staging
        stager = DefaultStager(StagingOptions(use_async_staging=False))
        staged_dict = stager.stage(state_dict)
        stager.close()

        # Asynchronous staging
        stager = DefaultStager(StagingOptions(use_async_staging=True))
        future = stager.stage(state_dict)
        # ... do other work ...
        staged_dict = future.result()
        stager.close()

        # Context manager pattern (recommended)
        stager = DefaultStager(config)
        with stager:
        result = stager.stage(state_dict)

    Performance Considerations:
        - Async staging provides best performance when model computation
          can overlap with staging operations
        - Pinned memory improves CPU-GPU transfer speeds but uses more memory
        - Shared memory allows efficient IPC to checkpoint process
        - Non-blocking copies reduce GPU idle time during memory transfers

    Thread Safety:
        DefaultStager is not thread-safe. Each thread should use its own
        instance, or external synchronization should be provided.
