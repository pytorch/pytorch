    Implements a
    :py:class:`torch.distributed.elastic.rendezvous.RendezvousHandler` interface
    backed by
    :py:class:`torch.distributed.elastic.rendezvous.etcd_rendezvous.EtcdRendezvous`.
    ``EtcdRendezvousHandler`` uses a URL to configure the type of rendezvous to
    use and to pass implementation specific configurations to the rendezvous
    module. The basic etcd rendezvous configuration URL looks like the following
    ::

     etcd://<etcd_address>:<port>/<job_id>?min_workers=<min_workers>&max_workers=<max_workers>  # noqa: W605

     -- example --

     etcd://localhost:2379/1234?min_workers=1&max_workers=3

    The URL above is interpreted as follows:

    1. Use the rendezvous handler that is registered with the ``etcd``
       scheme
    2. The ``etcd`` endpoint to use is ``localhost:2379``
    3. ``job_id == 1234`` is used as the prefix in etcd (this allows one to
       share a common etcd server for multiple jobs so long as the
       ``job_ids`` are guaranteed to be unique). Note that the job id can be
       any string (e.g. does not need to be a number) as long as it is
       unique.
    4. ``min_workers=1`` and ``max_workers=3`` specifies a range for
       membership size - Torch Distributed Elastic starts running the job as
       long as the cluster size is greater than or equal to ``min_workers``
       and admits up to ``max_workers`` into the cluster.

    Below are a full list of the parameters that can be passed to etcd
    rendezvous:
