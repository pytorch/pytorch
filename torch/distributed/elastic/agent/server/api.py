        the following algorithm:

        1. Each agent writes its configuration(group_rank, group_world_size
           , num_workers) to the common store.
        2. The rank 0 agent reads all the role_info from the store and
           determines each agents worker ranks.
        3. Determine the global rank: the global rank of the workers is computed
           by cumulative sum of the local_world_size for all workers in front of it.
           For efficiency reasons each worker is assigned a base global rank
           such that it's workers are in the range [base_global_rank,
           base_global_rank + local_world_size).
        4. Determine the role rank: The role rank is determined using the algorithms
           in the point 3 with the exception that the ranks are calculated with
           respect to the role name.
        5. The rank 0 agent writes the assigned ranks to the store.
        6. Each agent reads the assigned ranks from the store.

        Time complexity: each worker O(1), rank0 O(n), overall O(n)
