class ModelReportVisualizer:
    r"""
    The ModelReportVisualizer class aims to provide users a way to visualize some of the statistics
    that were generated by the ModelReport API. However, at a higher level, the class aims to provide
    some level of visualization of statistics to PyTorch in order to make it easier to parse data and
    diagnose any potential issues with data or a specific model. With respect to the visualizations,
    the ModelReportVisualizer class currently supports several methods of visualizing data.

    Supported Visualization Methods Include:
    - Table format
    - Plot format (line graph)
    - Histogram format

    For all of the existing visualization methods, there is the option to filter data based on:
    - A module fqn prefix
    - Feature [required for the plot and histogram]

    * :attr:`generated_reports` The reports generated by the ModelReport class in the structure below
        Ensure sure that features that are the same across different report contain the same name
        Ensure that objects representing the same features are the same type / dimension (where applicable)

    Note:
        Currently, the ModelReportVisualizer class supports visualization of data generated by the
        ModelReport class. However, this structure is extensible and should allow the visualization of
        other information as long as the information is structured in the following general format:

        Report Structure
        -- module_fqn [module with attached detectors]
            |
            -- feature keys [not every detector extracts same information]
                                    [same collected info has same keys, unless can be specific to detector]


    The goal behind the class is that the generated visualizations can be used in conjunction with the generated
    report for people to get a better understanding of issues and what the fix might be. It is also just to provide
    a good visualization platform, since it might be hard to parse through the ModelReport returned dictionary as
    that grows in size.

    General Use Flow Expected
    1.) Initialize ModelReport object with reports of interest by passing in initialized detector objects
    2.) Prepare your model with prepare_fx
    3.) Call model_report.prepare_detailed_calibration on your model to add relavent observers
    4.) Callibrate your model with data
    5.) Call model_report.generate_report on your model to generate report and optionally remove added observers
    6.) Use output of model_report.generate_report to initialize ModelReportVisualizer instance
    7.) Use instance to view different views of data as desired, applying filters as needed
