    r"""Nearly Diagonal Sparsifier

    This sparsifier creates a nearly diagonal mask to be applied to the weight matrix.
    Nearly Diagonal Matrix is a matrix that contains non-zero elements near the diagonal and the rest are zero.
    An example of a nearly diagonal matrix with degree (or nearliness) 3 and 5 are follows respectively.
    1 1 0 0       1 1 1 0
    1 1 1 0       1 1 1 1
    0 1 1 1       1 1 1 1
    0 0 1 1       0 1 1 1
    Note that a nearly diagonal matrix with degree 1 is just a matrix with main diagonal populated

    This sparsifier is controlled by one variable:
    1. `nearliness` defines the number of non-zero diagonal lines that are closest to the main diagonal.
        Currently - supports only odd number

    Note:
        This can be accelerated (vectorized) once the Spdiagonal feature (PR: #78439) is landed or the banded matrix
        feature is landed: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52463972/generating-banded-matrices-using-numpy
