    Each graphed callable's forward pass runs its source callable's
    forward CUDA work as a CUDA graph inside a single autograd node.

    The graphed callable's forward pass also appends
    a backward node to the autograd graph. During backward, this node runs the
    callable's backward work as a CUDA graph.

    Therefore, each graphed callable should be a drop-in replacement for its source callable
    in an autograd-enabled training loop.

    See :ref:`Partial-network capture<partial-network-capture>` for detailed use and constraints.

    If you pass a tuple of several callables, their captures will use the same memory pool.
    See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when this is appropriate.

    Arguments:
        callables (torch.nn.Module or Python function, or tuple of these): Callable or callables to graph.
            See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when passing a tuple of callables
            is appropriate.  If you pass a tuple of callables, their order in the tuple must be the same order
            they'll run in the live workload.
        sample_args (tuple of Tensors, or tuple of tuples of Tensors): Samples args for each callable.
            If a single callable was passed, ``sample_args`` must be a single tuple of argument Tensors.
            If a tuple of callables was passed, ``sample_args`` must be tuple of tuples of argument Tensors.
        num_warmup_iters (int): The number of warmup iterations. Currently, ``DataDistributedParallel`` needs
            11 iterations for warm up. Default: ``3``.
        allow_unused_input (bool): If False, specifying inputs that were not used when computing outputs
            (and therefore their grad is always zero) is an error. Defaults to False.
        pool (optional): Token (returned by :func:`~torch.cuda.graph_pool_handle` or
            :meth:`other_Graph_instance.pool()<torch.cuda.CUDAGraph.pool>`) that hints this graph may share memory
            with the indicated pool.  See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>`.
