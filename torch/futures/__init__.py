        Create an empty unset ``Future``. If the future is intended to hold
        values containing CUDA tensors, (a superset of) their CUDA devices must
        be specified at construction. (This is only supported if
        ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` returns ``True``). This is needed to
        ensure proper CUDA stream synchronization. The child futures, returned
        by the ``then`` method, will inherit these devices.

        Args:

        Block until the value of this ``Future`` is ready.

        If the value contains tensors that reside on GPUs, then an additional
        synchronization is performed with the kernels (executing on the device)
        which may be asynchronously populating those tensors. Such sync is
        non-blocking, which means that ``wait()`` will insert the necessary
        instructions in the current streams to ensure that further operations
        enqueued on those streams will be properly scheduled after the async
        kernels but, once that is done, ``wait()`` will return, even if those
        kernels are still running. No further synchronization is required when
        accessing and using the values, as long as one doesn't change streams.

        Returns:
            The value held by this ``Future``. If the function (callback or RPC)
            creating the value has thrown an error, this ``wait`` method will
            also throw an error.

        This method should only be called after a call to :meth:`wait` has
        completed, or inside a callback function passed to :meth:`then`. In
        other cases this ``Future`` may not yet hold a value and calling
        ``value()`` could fail.

        If the value contains tensors that reside on GPUs, then this method will
        *not* perform any additional synchronization. This should be done
        beforehand, separately, through a call to :meth:`wait` (except within

        Returns:

    def then(self, callback: Callable[[Future[T]], S]) -> Future[S]:
        r"""
        Append the given callback function to this ``Future``, which will be run
        when the ``Future`` is completed.  Multiple callbacks can be added to
        the same ``Future``, but the order in which they will be executed cannot
        be guaranteed (to enforce a certain order consider chaining:
        ``fut.then(cb1).then(cb2)``). The callback must take one argument, which
        is the reference to this ``Future``. The callback function can use the
        :meth:`value` method to get the value. Note that if this ``Future`` is
        already completed, the given callback will be run immediately inline.

        If the ``Future``'s value contains tensors that reside on GPUs, the
        callback might be invoked while the async kernels that are populating
        those tensors haven't yet finished executing on the device. However, the
        callback will be invoked with some dedicated streams set as current
        (fetched from a global pool) which will be synchronized with those
        kernels. Hence any operation performed by the callback on these tensors
        will be scheduled on the device after the kernels complete. In other
        words, as long as the callback doesn't switch streams, it can safely
        manipulate the result without any additional synchronization. This is
        similar to the non-blocking behavior of :meth:`wait`.

        Similarly, if the callback returns a value that contains tensors that
        reside on a GPU, it can do so even if the kernels that are producing
        these tensors are still running on the device, as long as the callback
        didn't change streams during its execution. If one wants to change
        streams, one must be careful to re-synchronize them with the original
        streams, that is, those that were current when the callback was invoked.

        Args:
            callback(``Callable``): a ``Callable`` that takes this ``Future`` as
                                    the only argument.

        Returns:
            A new ``Future`` object that holds the return value of the
            ``callback`` and will be marked as completed when the given
            ``callback`` finishes.

        .. note:: Note that if the callback function throws, either
            through the original future being completed with an exception and
            calling ``fut.wait()``, or through other code in the callback, the
            future returned by ``then`` will be marked appropriately with the
            encountered error. However, if this callback later completes
            additional futures, those futures are not marked as completed with
            an error and the user is responsible for handling completion/waiting
            on those futures independently.

        Example::

            >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_FUTURES)

        Append the given callback function to this ``Future``, which will be run

        :meth:`value` method to get the value. Note that if this ``Future`` is
        already completed, the given callback will be run inline.

        We recommend that you use the :meth:`then` method as it provides a way
        to synchronize after your callback has completed. ``add_done_callback``
        can be cheaper if your callback does not return anything. But both
        :meth:`then` and ``add_done_callback`` use the same callback
        registration API under the hood.

        With respect to GPU tensors, this method behaves in the same way as
        :meth:`then`.

        Args:
            callback(``Future``): a ``Callable`` that takes in one argument,

            through the original future being completed with an exception and
            calling ``fut.wait()``, or through other code in the callback,
            error handling must be carefully taken care of. For example, if
            this callback later completes additional futures, those futures are
            not marked as completed with an error and the user is responsible
            for handling completion/waiting on those futures independently.

        called even if the asynchronous kernels that are populating those
        tensors haven't yet completed running on the device, provided that the
