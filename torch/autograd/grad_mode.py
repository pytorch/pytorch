class no_grad(_NoParamDecoratorContextManager):
    r"""Context-manager that disables gradient calculation.

    Disabling gradient calculation is useful for inference, when you are sure
    that you will not call :meth:`Tensor.backward()`. It will reduce memory
    consumption for computations that would otherwise have `requires_grad=True`.

    In this mode, the result of every computation will have
    `requires_grad=False`, even when the inputs have `requires_grad=True`.
    There is an exception! All factory functions, or functions that create
    a new Tensor and take a requires_grad kwarg, will NOT be affected by
    this mode.

    This context manager is thread local; it will not affect computation
    in other threads.

    Also functions as a decorator.

    .. note::
        No-grad is one of several mechanisms that can enable or
        disable gradients locally see :ref:`locally-disable-grad-doc` for
        more information on how they compare.

    .. note::
        This API does not apply to :ref:`forward-mode AD <forward-mode-ad>`.
        If you want to disable forward AD for a computation, you can unpack
        your dual tensors.

        >>> x = torch.tensor([1.], requires_grad=True)
