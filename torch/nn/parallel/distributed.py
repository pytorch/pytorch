class _MixedPrecision:
    """
    This configures DDP-native mixed precision training.

    Attributes:
        param_dtype (torch.dtype): This specifies the dtype for model
            parameters, inputs (when ``cast_forward_inputs`` is set to
            ``True``), and therefore the dtype for computation.
            However, outside the forward and backward passes, parameters are in
            full precision. Model checkpointing always happens in full
            precision.
        reduce_dtype (torch.dtype): This specifies the dtype for gradient
            reduction, which is permitted to differ from ``param_dtype``.
        buffer_dtype (torch.dtype): This specifies the dtype for buffers.

    .. note:: This API is experimental and subject to change.

    .. note:: Only floating point tensors are cast to their specified dtypes.

    .. note:: ``state_dict`` checkpoints parameters and buffers in full
        precision.

    .. note:: Each low precision dtype must be specified explicitly. For
        example, ``_MixedPrecision(reduce_dtype=torch.float16)`` only specifies
        the reduction dtype to be low precision, and DDP will not cast
        parameters or buffers.

    .. note:: If a ``reduce_dtype`` is not specified, then gradient reduction
        happens in ``param_dtype`` if specified or the original parameter dtype
        otherwise. For example, ``_MixedPrecision(param_dtype=torch.float16)``
        would result in communication occurring in fp16.

class DistributedDataParallel(Module, Joinable):
    r"""Implement distributed data parallelism based on ``torch.distributed`` at module level.

    This container provides data parallelism by synchronizing gradients
    across each model replica. The devices to synchronize across are
    specified by the input ``process_group``, which is the entire world
    by default. Note that ``DistributedDataParallel`` does not chunk or
    otherwise shard the input across participating GPUs; the user is
    responsible for defining how to do so, for example through the use
    of a :class:`DistributedSampler`.

    See also: :ref:`distributed-basics` and :ref:`cuda-nn-ddp-instead`.
    The same constraints on input as in :class:`torch.nn.DataParallel` apply.

    Creation of this class requires that ``torch.distributed`` to be already
    initialized, by calling :func:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`.

    ``DistributedDataParallel`` is proven to be significantly faster than
    :class:`torch.nn.DataParallel` for single-node multi-GPU data
    parallel training.

    To use ``DistributedDataParallel`` on a host with N GPUs, you should spawn
    up ``N`` processes, ensuring that each process exclusively works on a single
    GPU from 0 to N-1. This can be done by either setting
    ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` for every process or by calling:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
        >>> torch.cuda.set_device(i)

    where i is from 0 to N-1. In each process, you should refer the following
    to construct this module:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
        >>> torch.distributed.init_process_group(
        >>>     backend='nccl', world_size=N, init_method='...'
        >>> )
        >>> model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[i], output_device=i)

    In order to spawn up multiple processes per node, you can use either
    ``torch.distributed.launch`` or ``torch.multiprocessing.spawn``.

    .. note::
        Please refer to `PyTorch Distributed Overview <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html>`__
        for a brief introduction to all features related to distributed training.

    .. note::
        ``DistributedDataParallel`` can be used in conjunction with
        :class:`torch.distributed.optim.ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` to reduce
        per-rank optimizer states memory footprint. Please refer to
        `ZeroRedundancyOptimizer recipe <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/zero_redundancy_optimizer.html>`__
        for more details.

    .. note:: ``nccl`` backend is currently the fastest and highly recommended
        backend when using GPUs. This applies to both single-node and
        multi-node distributed training.

    .. note:: This module also supports mixed-precision distributed training.
        This means that your model can have different types of parameters such
        as mixed types of ``fp16`` and ``fp32``, the gradient reduction on these
        mixed types of parameters will just work fine.

    .. note:: If you use ``torch.save`` on one process to checkpoint the module,
        and ``torch.load`` on some other processes to recover it, make sure that
        ``map_location`` is configured properly for every process. Without
        ``map_location``, ``torch.load`` would recover the module to devices
        where the module was saved from.

    .. note:: When a model is trained on ``M`` nodes with ``batch=N``, the
        gradient will be ``M`` times smaller when compared to the same model
        trained on a single node with ``batch=M*N`` if the loss is summed (NOT
        averaged as usual) across instances in a batch (because the gradients
        between different nodes are averaged). You should take this into
        consideration when you want to obtain a mathematically equivalent
        training process compared to the local training counterpart. But in most
        cases, you can just treat a DistributedDataParallel wrapped model, a
        DataParallel wrapped model and an ordinary model on a single GPU as the
        same (E.g. using the same learning rate for equivalent batch size).

    .. note::
        Parameters are never broadcast between processes. The module performs
        an all-reduce step on gradients and assumes that they will be modified
        by the optimizer in all processes in the same way. Buffers
        (e.g. BatchNorm stats) are broadcast from the module in process of rank
        0, to all other replicas in the system in every iteration.

    .. note::
        If you are using DistributedDataParallel in conjunction with the
        :ref:`distributed-rpc-framework`, you should always use
        :meth:`torch.distributed.autograd.backward` to compute gradients and
        :class:`torch.distributed.optim.DistributedOptimizer` for optimizing
        parameters.

        Example::

            >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
            >>> import torch.distributed.autograd as dist_autograd
            >>> from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
            >>> import torch
            >>> from torch import optim
            >>> from torch.distributed.optim import DistributedOptimizer
            >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
            >>> from torch.distributed.rpc import RRef
            >>>
            >>> t1 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
            >>> t2 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
            >>> rref = rpc.remote("worker1", torch.add, args=(t1, t2))
            >>> ddp_model = DDP(my_model)
            >>>
            >>> # Setup optimizer
            >>> optimizer_params = [rref]
            >>> for param in ddp_model.parameters():
            >>>     optimizer_params.append(RRef(param))
            >>>
            >>> dist_optim = DistributedOptimizer(
            >>>     optim.SGD,
            >>>     optimizer_params,
            >>>     lr=0.05,
            >>> )
            >>>
            >>> with dist_autograd.context() as context_id:
            >>>     pred = ddp_model(rref.to_here())
            >>>     loss = loss_func(pred, target)
            >>>     dist_autograd.backward(context_id, [loss])
            >>>     dist_optim.step(context_id)

    .. note::
        DistributedDataParallel currently offers limited support for gradient
        checkpointing with :meth:`torch.utils.checkpoint`.
        If the checkpoint is done with use_reentrant=False (recommended), DDP
        will work as expected without any limitations.
        If, however, the checkpoint is done with use_reentrant=True (the default),
        DDP will work as expected when there are no unused parameters in the model
        and each layer is checkpointed at most once (make sure you are not passing
        `find_unused_parameters=True` to DDP). We currently do not support the
        case where a layer is checkpointed multiple times, or when there unused
        parameters in the checkpointed model.

    .. note::
        To let a non-DDP model load a state dict from a DDP model,
        :meth:`~torch.nn.modules.utils.consume_prefix_in_state_dict_if_present`
        needs to be applied to strip the prefix "module." in the DDP state dict before loading.

    .. warning::
        Constructor, forward method, and differentiation of the output (or a
        function of the output of this module) are distributed synchronization
        points. Take that into account in case different processes might be
        executing different code.

    .. warning::
        This module assumes all parameters are registered in the model by the
        time it is created. No parameters should be added nor removed later.
        Same applies to buffers.

    .. warning::
        This module assumes all parameters are registered in the model of each
        distributed processes are in the same order. The module itself will
        conduct gradient ``allreduce`` following the reverse order of the
        registered parameters of the model. In other words, it is users'
        responsibility to ensure that each distributed process has the exact
        same model and thus the exact same parameter registration order.

    .. warning::
        This module allows parameters with non-rowmajor-contiguous strides.
        For example, your model may contain some parameters whose
        :class:`torch.memory_format` is ``torch.contiguous_format``
        and others whose format is ``torch.channels_last``.  However,
        corresponding parameters in different processes must have the
        same strides.

    .. warning::
        This module doesn't work with :func:`torch.autograd.grad` (i.e. it will
        only work if gradients are to be accumulated in ``.grad`` attributes of
        parameters).

    .. warning::
        If you plan on using this module with a ``nccl`` backend or a ``gloo``
        backend (that uses Infiniband), together with a DataLoader that uses
        multiple workers, please change the multiprocessing start method to
        ``forkserver`` (Python 3 only) or ``spawn``. Unfortunately
        Gloo (that uses Infiniband) and NCCL2 are not fork safe, and you will
        likely experience deadlocks if you don't change this setting.

    .. warning::
        You should never try to change your model's parameters after wrapping
        up your model with ``DistributedDataParallel``. Because, when
        wrapping up your model with ``DistributedDataParallel``, the constructor
        of ``DistributedDataParallel`` will register the additional gradient
        reduction functions on all the parameters of the model itself at the
        time of construction. If you change the model's parameters afterwards,
        gradient reduction functions no longer match the correct set of
        parameters.

    .. warning::
        Using ``DistributedDataParallel`` in conjunction with the
        :ref:`distributed-rpc-framework` is experimental and subject to change.

        module (Module): module to be parallelized

                   1) For single-device modules, ``device_ids`` can
                   contain exactly one device id, which represents the only
                   CUDA device where the input module corresponding to this process resides.
                   Alternatively, ``device_ids`` can also be ``None``.
                   2) For multi-device modules and CPU modules,
                   ``device_ids`` must be ``None``.

                   When ``device_ids`` is ``None`` for both cases,
                   both the input data for the forward pass and the actual module
                   must be placed on the correct device.
                   (default: ``None``)
        output_device (int or torch.device): Device location of output for
                      single-device CUDA modules. For multi-device modules and
                      CPU modules, it must be ``None``, and the module itself
                      dictates the output location. (default: ``device_ids[0]``
                      for single-device modules)
        broadcast_buffers (bool): Flag that enables syncing (broadcasting)
                          buffers of the module at beginning of the ``forward``
                          function. (default: ``True``)
        init_sync (bool): Whether to sync during initialization to verify param
                          shapes and broadcast parameters and buffers.
                          WARNING: if this is set to False the user is required
                          to ensure themselves that the weights are the same on
                          all ranks.
                          (default: ``True``)
        process_group: The process group to be used for distributed data
                       all-reduction. If ``None``, the default process group, which
                       is created by :func:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`,
                       will be used. (default: ``None``)
        bucket_cap_mb: ``DistributedDataParallel`` will bucket parameters into
                       multiple buckets so that gradient reduction of each
                       bucket can potentially overlap with backward computation.
                       :attr:`bucket_cap_mb` controls the bucket size in
                       MebiBytes (MiB). If ``None``, a default size of 25 MiB
                       will be used. (default: ``None``)
        find_unused_parameters (bool): Traverse the autograd graph from all
                               tensors contained in the return value of the
                               wrapped module's ``forward`` function. Parameters
                               that don't receive gradients as part of this
                               graph are preemptively marked as being ready to
                               be reduced. In addition, parameters that may have
                               been used in the wrapped module's ``forward``
                               function but were not part of loss computation and
                               thus would also not receive gradients are
                               preemptively marked as ready to be reduced.
                               (default: ``False``)
        check_reduction: This argument is deprecated.
        gradient_as_bucket_view (bool): When set to ``True``, gradients will be views
                      pointing to different offsets of ``allreduce`` communication
                      buckets. This can reduce peak memory usage, where the
                      saved memory size will be equal to the total gradients
                      size. Moreover, it avoids the overhead of copying between
                      gradients and ``allreduce`` communication buckets. When
                      gradients are views, ``detach_()`` cannot be called on the
                      gradients. If hitting such errors, please fix it by
                      referring to the :meth:`~torch.optim.Optimizer.zero_grad`
                      function in ``torch/optim/optimizer.py`` as a solution.
                      Note that gradients will be views after first iteration, so
                      the peak memory saving should be checked after first iteration.
        static_graph (bool): When set to ``True``, DDP knows the trained graph is
                     static. Static graph means 1) The set of used and unused
                     parameters will not change during the whole training loop; in
                     this case, it does not matter whether users set
                     ``find_unused_parameters = True`` or not. 2) How the graph is trained
                     will not change during the whole training loop (meaning there is
                     no control flow depending on iterations).
                     When static_graph is set to be ``True``, DDP will support cases that
                     can not be supported in the past:
                     1) Reentrant backwards.
                     2) Activation checkpointing multiple times.
                     3) Activation checkpointing when model has unused parameters.
                     4) There are model parameters that are outside of forward function.
                     5) Potentially improve performance when there are unused parameters,
                     as DDP will not search graph in each iteration to detect unused
                     parameters when static_graph is set to be ``True``.
                     To check whether you can set static_graph to be ``True``, one way is to
                     check ddp logging data at the end of your previous model training,
                     if ``ddp_logging_data.get("can_set_static_graph") == True``, mostly you
                     can set ``static_graph = True`` as well.

                     Example::
                         >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
                         >>> model_DDP = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)
                         >>> # Training loop
                         >>> ...
                         >>> ddp_logging_data = model_DDP._get_ddp_logging_data()
                         >>> static_graph = ddp_logging_data.get("can_set_static_graph")
        delay_all_reduce_named_params (list of tuple of str and torch.nn.Parameter): a list
                    of named parameters whose all reduce will be delayed when the gradient of
                    the parameter specified in ``param_to_hook_all_reduce`` is ready. Other
                    arguments of DDP do not apply to named params specified in this argument
                    as these named params will be ignored by DDP reducer.
        param_to_hook_all_reduce (torch.nn.Parameter): a parameter to hook delayed all reduce
                    of parameters specified in ``delay_all_reduce_named_params``.
        skip_all_reduce_unused_params: When set to True, DDP will skip reducing unused parameters.
                    This requires that unused parameters remain the same across all ranks throughout
                    the entire training process. If this condition is not met, it may cause
                    desynchronization and result in training hang.

        Context manager for training with uneven inputs across processes in DDP.

        This context manager will keep track of already-joined DDP processes,
        and "shadow" the forward and backward passes by inserting collective
        communication operations to match with the ones created by non-joined
        DDP processes. This will ensure each collective call has a corresponding
        call by already-joined DDP processes, preventing hangs or errors that
        would otherwise happen when training with uneven inputs across
        processes. Alternatively, if the flag ``throw_on_early_termination`` is
        specified to be ``True``, all trainers will throw an error once one rank
        runs out of inputs, allowing these errors to be caught and handled
        according to application logic.

        Once all DDP processes have joined, the context manager will broadcast
        the model corresponding to the last joined process to all processes to
        ensure the model is the same across all processes
        (which is guaranteed by DDP).

        To use this to enable training with uneven inputs across processes,
        simply wrap this context manager around your training loop. No further
        modifications to the model or data loading is required.

        .. warning::
            If the model or training loop this context manager is wrapped around
            has additional distributed collective operations, such as
            ``SyncBatchNorm`` in the model's forward pass, then the flag
            ``throw_on_early_termination`` must be enabled. This is because this
            context manager is not aware of non-DDP collective communication.
            This flag will cause all ranks to throw when any one rank
            exhausts inputs, allowing these errors to be caught and recovered
            from across all ranks.

        Args:
            divide_by_initial_world_size (bool): If ``True``, will divide
                gradients by the initial ``world_size`` DDP training was launched
                with. If ``False``, will compute the effective world size
                (number of ranks that have not depleted their inputs yet) and
                divide gradients by that during allreduce. Set
                ``divide_by_initial_world_size=True`` to ensure every input
                sample including the uneven inputs have equal weight in terms of
                how much they contribute to the global gradient. This is
                achieved by always dividing the gradient by the initial
                ``world_size`` even when we encounter uneven inputs. If you set
                this to ``False``, we divide the gradient by the remaining
                number of nodes. This ensures parity with training on a smaller
                ``world_size`` although it also means the uneven inputs would
                contribute more towards the global gradient. Typically, you
                would want to set this to ``True`` for cases where the last few
                inputs of your training job are uneven. In extreme cases, where
                there is a large discrepancy in the number of inputs, setting
                this to ``False`` might provide better results.
            enable (bool): Whether to enable uneven input detection or not. Pass
                in ``enable=False`` to disable in cases where you know that
                inputs are even across participating processes. Default is
                ``True``.
            throw_on_early_termination (bool): Whether to throw an error
                or continue training when at least one rank has exhausted
                inputs. If ``True``, will throw upon the first rank reaching end
                of data. If ``False``, will continue training with a smaller
                effective world size until all ranks are joined. Note that if
                this flag is specified, then the flag
                ``divide_by_initial_world_size`` would be ignored. Default
                is ``False``.

        and gradient compression which involve different communication strategies for
        parameter syncs while running Distributed DataParallel training.
