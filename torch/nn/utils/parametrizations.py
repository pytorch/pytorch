    r"""Apply an orthogonal or unitary parametrization to a matrix or a batch of matrices.

    Letting :math:`\mathbb{K}` be :math:`\mathbb{R}` or :math:`\mathbb{C}`, the parametrized
    matrix :math:`Q \in \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}` is **orthogonal** as

    .. math::

        \begin{align*}
            Q^{\text{H}}Q &= \mathrm{I}_n \mathrlap{\qquad \text{if }m \geq n}\\
            QQ^{\text{H}} &= \mathrm{I}_m \mathrlap{\qquad \text{if }m < n}
        \end{align*}

    where :math:`Q^{\text{H}}` is the conjugate transpose when :math:`Q` is complex
    and the transpose when :math:`Q` is real-valued, and
    :math:`\mathrm{I}_n` is the `n`-dimensional identity matrix.
    In plain words, :math:`Q` will have orthonormal columns whenever :math:`m \geq n`
    and orthonormal rows otherwise.

    If the tensor has more than two dimensions, we consider it as a batch of matrices of shape `(..., m, n)`.

    The matrix :math:`Q` may be parametrized via three different ``orthogonal_map`` in terms of the original tensor:

    - ``"matrix_exp"``/``"cayley"``:
      the :func:`~torch.matrix_exp` :math:`Q = \exp(A)` and the `Cayley map`_
      :math:`Q = (\mathrm{I}_n + A/2)(\mathrm{I}_n - A/2)^{-1}` are applied to a skew-symmetric
      :math:`A` to give an orthogonal matrix.
    - ``"householder"``: computes a product of Householder reflectors
      (:func:`~torch.linalg.householder_product`).

    ``"matrix_exp"``/``"cayley"`` often make the parametrized weight converge faster than
    ``"householder"``, but they are slower to compute for very thin or very wide matrices.

    If ``use_trivialization=True`` (default), the parametrization implements the "Dynamic Trivialization Framework",
    where an extra matrix :math:`B \in \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}` is stored under
    ``module.parametrizations.weight[0].base``. This helps the
    convergence of the parametrized layer at the expense of some extra memory use.
    See `Trivializations for Gradient-Based Optimization on Manifolds`_ .

    Initial value of :math:`Q`:
    If the original tensor is not parametrized and ``use_trivialization=True`` (default), the initial value
    of :math:`Q` is that of the original tensor if it is orthogonal (or unitary in the complex case)
    and it is orthogonalized via the QR decomposition otherwise (see :func:`torch.linalg.qr`).
    Same happens when it is not parametrized and ``orthogonal_map="householder"`` even when ``use_trivialization=False``.
    Otherwise, the initial value is the result of the composition of all the registered
    parametrizations applied to the original tensor.

    .. note::
        This function is implemented using the parametrization functionality
        in :func:`~torch.nn.utils.parametrize.register_parametrization`.

        #     runs its own spectral norm power iteration. So simply assigning
        #     the updated vectors to the module this function runs on will cause
        #     the update to be lost forever. And the next time the parallelized
        #     module is replicated, the same randomly initialized vectors are
        #     broadcast and used!
        #
        #     Therefore, to make the change propagate back, we rely on two
        #     important behaviors (also enforced via tests):
        #       1. `DataParallel` doesn't clone storage if the broadcast tensor
        #          is already on correct device; and it makes sure that the
        #          parallelized module is already on `device[0]`.
        #       2. If the out tensor in `out=` kwarg has correct shape, it will
        #          just fill in the values.
        #     Therefore, since the same power iteration is performed on all
        #     devices, simply updating the tensors in-place will make sure that
        #     the module replica on `device[0]` will update the _u vector on the
        #     parallelized module (by shared storage).
        #
        #    However, after we update `u` and `v` in-place, we need to **clone**
        #    them before using them to normalize the weight. This is to support
        #    backproping through two forward passes, e.g., the common pattern in
        #    GAN training: loss = D(real) - D(fake). Otherwise, engine will
        #    complain that variables needed to do backward for the first forward
        #    (i.e., the `u` and `v` vectors) are changed in the second forward.

    r"""Apply spectral normalization to a parameter in the given module.

    .. math::
        \mathbf{W}_{SN} = \dfrac{\mathbf{W}}{\sigma(\mathbf{W})},
        \sigma(\mathbf{W}) = \max_{\mathbf{h}: \mathbf{h} \ne 0} \dfrac{\|\mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}\|_2}{\|\mathbf{h}\|_2}

    When applied on a vector, it simplifies to

    Spectral normalization stabilizes the training of discriminators (critics)
    in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by reducing the Lipschitz constant
    of the model. :math:`\sigma` is approximated performing one iteration of the
    `power method`_ every time the weight is accessed. If the dimension of the
    weight tensor is greater than 2, it is reshaped to 2D in power iteration
    method to get spectral norm.

    .. note::
        This function is implemented using the parametrization functionality
        in :func:`~torch.nn.utils.parametrize.register_parametrization`. It is a
        reimplementation of :func:`torch.nn.utils.spectral_norm`.

    .. note::
        When this constraint is registered, the singular vectors associated to the largest
        singular value are estimated rather than sampled at random. These are then updated
        performing :attr:`n_power_iterations` of the `power method`_ whenever the tensor
        is accessed with the module on `training` mode.

    .. note::
        If the `_SpectralNorm` module, i.e., `module.parametrization.weight[idx]`,
        is in training mode on removal, it will perform another power iteration.
        If you'd like to avoid this iteration, set the module to eval mode
        before its removal.
