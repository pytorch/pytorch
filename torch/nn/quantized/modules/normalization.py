    .. math::
        y = \frac{x - \mathrm{E}[x]}{ \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} * \gamma + \beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated separately over the last
    certain number dimensions which have to be of the shape specified by
    :attr:`normalized_shape`.
    :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable affine transform parameters of
    :attr:`normalized_shape` if :attr:`elementwise_affine` is ``True``.

    .. note::
        Unlike Batch Normalization and Instance Normalization, which applies
        scalar scale and bias for each entire channel/plane with the
        :attr:`affine` option, Layer Normalization applies per-element scale and
        bias with :attr:`elementwise_affine`.

    This layer uses statistics computed from input data in both training and
    evaluation modes.

            If a single integer is used, it is treated as a singleton list, and this module will
            normalize over the last dimension which is expected to be of that specific size.
        eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default: 1e-5
