    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the mean absolute error (MAE) between each element in

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad

    :math:`x` and :math:`y` are tensors of arbitrary shapes with a total

    The sum operation still operates over all the elements, and divides by :math:`N`.

    The division by :math:`N` can be avoided if one sets ``reduction = 'sum'``.

    Supports real-valued and complex-valued inputs.

class NLLLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.

    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case. The latter is useful for
    higher dimension inputs, such as computing NLL loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \\
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \\
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},

    where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight, and
    :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, it has to be a Tensor of size `C`. Otherwise, it is
            treated as if having all ones.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``None``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When
            :attr:`size_average` is ``True``, the loss is averaged over
            non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``None``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape::
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(C)`, where `C = number of classes`, `N = batch size`, or

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets :math:`y` should be numbers

    Notice that if :math:`x_n` is either 0 or 1, one of the log terms would be
    mathematically undefined in the above loss equation. PyTorch chooses to set
    :math:`\log (0) = -\infty`, since :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \log (x) = -\infty`.
    However, an infinite term in the loss equation is not desirable for several reasons.

    For one, if either :math:`y_n = 0` or :math:`(1 - y_n) = 0`, then we would be
    multiplying 0 with infinity. Secondly, if we have an infinite loss value, then
    we would also have an infinite term in our gradient, since
    :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{d}{dx} \log (x) = \infty`.
    This would make BCELoss's backward method nonlinear with respect to :math:`x_n`,
    and using it for things like linear regression would not be straight-forward.

    Our solution is that BCELoss clamps its log function outputs to be greater than
    or equal to -100. This way, we can always have a finite loss value and a linear
    backward method.

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then ``pos_weight`` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples:

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10
        >>> output = torch.full([10, 64], 1.5)  # A prediction (logit)
        >>> pos_weight = torch.ones([64])  # All weights are equal to 1
        >>> criterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
        >>> criterion(output, target)  # -log(sigmoid(1.5))
        tensor(0.20...)

    In the above example, the ``pos_weight`` tensor's elements correspond to the 64 distinct classes
    in a multi-label binary classification scenario. Each element in ``pos_weight`` is designed to adjust the
    loss function based on the imbalance between negative and positive samples for the respective class.
    This approach is useful in datasets with varying levels of class imbalance, ensuring that the loss
    calculation accurately accounts for the distribution in each class.

            size [B, C, H, W] will apply different pos_weights to each element of the batch or
            [C, H, W] the same pos_weights across the batch. To apply the same positive weight

class SmoothL1Loss(_Loss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that uses a squared term if the absolute

    It is less sensitive to outliers than :class:`torch.nn.MSELoss` and in some cases
    prevents exploding gradients (e.g. see the paper `Fast R-CNN`_ by Ross Girshick).

    For a batch of size :math:`N`, the unreduced loss can be described as:

    .. note::
        Smooth L1 loss can be seen as exactly :class:`L1Loss`, but with the :math:`|x - y| < beta`
        portion replaced with a quadratic function such that its slope is 1 at :math:`|x - y| = beta`.
        The quadratic segment smooths the L1 loss near :math:`|x - y| = 0`.

    .. note::
        Smooth L1 loss is closely related to :class:`HuberLoss`, being
        equivalent to :math:`huber(x, y) / beta` (note that Smooth L1's beta hyper-parameter is
        also known as delta for Huber). This leads to the following differences:

        * As beta -> 0, Smooth L1 loss converges to :class:`L1Loss`, while :class:`HuberLoss`
          converges to a constant 0 loss. When beta is 0, Smooth L1 loss is equivalent to L1 loss.
        * As beta -> :math:`+\infty`, Smooth L1 loss converges to a constant 0 loss, while
          :class:`HuberLoss` converges to :class:`MSELoss`.
        * For Smooth L1 loss, as beta varies, the L1 segment of the loss has a constant slope of 1.
          For :class:`HuberLoss`, the slope of the L1 segment is beta.

class CrossEntropyLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""This criterion computes the cross entropy loss between input logits
    and target.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain the unnormalized logits for each class (which do `not` need
    to be positive or sum to 1, in general).
    `input` has to be a Tensor of size :math:`(C)` for unbatched input,
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` for the
    `K`-dimensional case. The last being useful for higher dimension inputs, such
    as computing cross entropy loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    The `target` that this criterion expects should contain either:

    - Class indices in the range :math:`[0, C)` where :math:`C` is the number of classes; if
      `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts this class index (this index
      may not necessarily be in the class range). The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction`
      set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - w_{y_n} \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,y_n})}{\sum_{c=1}^C \exp(x_{n,c})}
          \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n} \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}} l_n, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

      Note that this case is equivalent to applying :class:`~torch.nn.LogSoftmax`
      on an input, followed by :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`.

    - Probabilities for each class; useful when labels beyond a single class per minibatch item
      are required, such as for blended labels, label smoothing, etc. The unreduced (i.e. with
      :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,c})}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp(x_{n,i})} y_{n,c}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N l_n}{N}, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

    .. note::
        The performance of this criterion is generally better when `target` contains class
        indices, as this allows for optimized computation. Consider providing `target` as
        class probabilities only when a single class label per minibatch item is too restrictive.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for

            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        label_smoothing (float, optional): A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount
            of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets
            become a mixture of the original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in
            `Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`__. Default: :math:`0.0`.

    Shape:
        - Input: Shape :math:`(C)`, :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: If containing class indices, shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with
          :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss where each value should be between :math:`[0, C)`. The
          target data type is required to be long when using class indices. If containing class probabilities, the
          target must be the same shape input, and each value should be between :math:`[0, 1]`. This means the target
          data type is required to be float when using class probabilities.
        - Output: If reduction is 'none', shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of K-dimensional loss, depending on the shape of the input. Otherwise, scalar.

            margins penalize cases where the negative examples are not distant enough from the
            anchors, relative to the positives. Default: :math:`1`.
        swap (bool, optional): Whether to use the distance swap described in the paper
            `Learning shallow convolutional feature descriptors with triplet losses` by
            V. Balntas, E. Riba et al. If True, and if the positive example is closer to the
            negative example than the anchor is, swaps the positive example and the anchor in
            the loss computation. Default: ``False``.
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the (optional) reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Default: ``'mean'``


    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` represents any number of additional dimensions
          as supported by the distance function.
        - Output: A Tensor of shape :math:`(N)` if :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, or a scalar
          otherwise.

    Examples:

    >>> # Initialize embeddings
    >>> embedding = nn.Embedding(1000, 128)
    >>> anchor_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> positive_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> negative_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> anchor = embedding(anchor_ids)
    >>> positive = embedding(positive_ids)
    >>> negative = embedding(negative_ids)
    >>>
    >>> # Built-in Distance Function
    >>> triplet_loss = \
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(distance_function=nn.PairwiseDistance())
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)
    >>> output.backward()
    >>>
    >>> # Custom Distance Function
    >>> def l_infinity(x1, x2):
    >>>     return torch.max(torch.abs(x1 - x2), dim=1).values
    >>>
    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("FIXME: Would call backwards a second time")
    >>> triplet_loss = (
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(distance_function=l_infinity, margin=1.5))
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)
    >>> output.backward()
    >>>
    >>> # Custom Distance Function (Lambda)
    >>> triplet_loss = (
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(
    >>>         distance_function=lambda x, y: 1.0 - F.cosine_similarity(x, y)))
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)

class CTCLoss(_Loss):
    r"""The Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.

    Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence. CTCLoss sums over the
    probability of possible alignments of input to target, producing a loss value which is differentiable
    with respect to each input node. The alignment of input to target is assumed to be "many-to-one", which
    limits the length of the target sequence such that it must be :math:`\leq` the input length.

    Args:
        blank (int, optional): blank label. Default :math:`0`.
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the output losses will be divided by the target lengths and
            then the mean over the batch is taken, ``'sum'``: the output losses will be summed.
            Default: ``'mean'``
        zero_infinity (bool, optional):
            Whether to zero infinite losses and the associated gradients.
            Default: ``False``
            Infinite losses mainly occur when the inputs are too short
            to be aligned to the targets.

    Shape:
        - Log_probs: Tensor of size :math:`(T, N, C)` or :math:`(T, C)`,
          where :math:`T = \text{input length}`,
          :math:`N = \text{batch size}`, and
          :math:`C = \text{number of classes (including blank)}`.
          The logarithmized probabilities of the outputs (e.g. obtained with
          :func:`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax`).
        - Targets: Tensor of size :math:`(N, S)` or
          :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}` and
          :math:`S = \text{max target length, if shape is } (N, S)`.
          It represents the target sequences. Each element in the target
          sequence is a class index. And the target index cannot be blank (default=0).
          In the :math:`(N, S)` form, targets are padded to the
          length of the longest sequence, and stacked.
          In the :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))` form,
          the targets are assumed to be un-padded and
          concatenated within 1 dimension.
        - Input_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represents the lengths of the
          inputs (must each be :math:`\leq T`). And the lengths are specified
          for each sequence to achieve masking under the assumption that sequences
          are padded to equal lengths.
        - Target_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represents lengths of the targets.
          Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the
          assumption that sequences are padded to equal lengths. If target shape is
          :math:`(N,S)`, target_lengths are effectively the stop index
          :math:`s_n` for each target sequence, such that ``target_n = targets[n,0:s_n]`` for
          each target in a batch. Lengths must each be :math:`\leq S`
          If the targets are given as a 1d tensor that is the concatenation of individual
          targets, the target_lengths must add up to the total length of the tensor.
        - Output: scalar if :attr:`reduction` is ``'mean'`` (default) or
          ``'sum'``. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(N)` if input is batched or
          :math:`()` if input is unbatched, where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`.

    Note:
        In order to use CuDNN, the following must be satisfied: :attr:`targets` must be
        in concatenated format, all :attr:`input_lengths` must be `T`.  :math:`blank=0`,
        :attr:`target_lengths` :math:`\leq 256`, the integer arguments must be of
        dtype :attr:`torch.int32`.

        The regular implementation uses the (more common in PyTorch) `torch.long` dtype.


    Note:
        In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
        may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is
        undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at
        a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic =
        True``.
