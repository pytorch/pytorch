    r"""Applies Instance Normalization.

    This operation applies Instance Normalization
    over a 2D (unbatched) or 3D (batched) input as described in the paper
    `Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022>`__.

    .. math::

        y = \frac{x - \mathrm{E}[x]}{ \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} * \gamma + \beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension separately
    for each object in a mini-batch. :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the number of features or channels of the input) if :attr:`affine` is ``True``.
    The variance is calculated via the biased estimator, equivalent to
    `torch.var(input, unbiased=False)`.

    By default, this layer uses instance statistics computed from input data in
    both training and evaluation modes.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``True``, during training this
    layer keeps running estimates of its computed mean and variance, which are
    then used for normalization during evaluation. The running estimates are
    kept with a default :attr:`momentum` of 0.1.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momentum} \times x_t`,
        where :math:`\hat{x}` is the estimated statistic and :math:`x_t` is the
        new observed value.

    .. note::
        :class:`InstanceNorm1d` and :class:`LayerNorm` are very similar, but
        have some subtle differences. :class:`InstanceNorm1d` is applied
        on each channel of channeled data like multidimensional time series, but
        :class:`LayerNorm` is usually applied on entire sample and often in NLP
        tasks. Additionally, :class:`LayerNorm` applies elementwise affine
        transform, while :class:`InstanceNorm1d` usually don't apply affine
        transform.

    Args:
        num_features: number of features or channels :math:`C` of the input
        eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default: 1e-5
        momentum: the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation. Default: 0.1
        affine: a boolean value that when set to ``True``, this module has
            learnable affine parameters, initialized the same way as done for batch normalization.
            Default: ``False``.
