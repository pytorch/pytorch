    Method described in the paper
    `Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
    Internal Covariate Shift <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167>`__ .

    .. math::

        y = \frac{x - \mathrm{E}[x]}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} * \gamma + \beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
    the mini-batches and :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the number of features or channels of the input). By default, the
    elements of :math:`\gamma` are set to 1 and the elements of :math:`\beta` are set to 0.
    At train time in the forward pass, the variance is calculated via the biased estimator,
    equivalent to ``torch.var(input, unbiased=False)``. However, the value stored in the
    moving average of the variance is calculated via the unbiased  estimator, equivalent to
    ``torch.var(input, unbiased=True)``.

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
    computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
    evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default :attr:`momentum`
    of 0.1.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``False``, this layer then does not
    keep running estimates, and batch statistics are instead used during
    evaluation time as well.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momentum} \times x_t`,
        where :math:`\hat{x}` is the estimated statistic and :math:`x_t` is the
        new observed value.

    Because the Batch Normalization is done over the `C` dimension, computing statistics
    on `(N, L)` slices, it's common terminology to call this Temporal Batch Normalization.

    Args:
        num_features: number of features or channels :math:`C` of the input
        eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
            Default: 1e-5
        momentum: the value used for the running_mean and running_var
            computation. Can be set to ``None`` for cumulative moving average

            learnable affine parameters. Default: ``True``

    r"""Applies Batch Normalization over a 5D input.

    5D is a mini-batch of 3D inputs with additional channel dimension as described in the paper
    `Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
    Internal Covariate Shift <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167>`__ .

    .. math::

        y = \frac{x - \mathrm{E}[x]}{ \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} * \gamma + \beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
    the mini-batches and :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the input size). By default, the elements of :math:`\gamma` are set
    to 1 and the elements of :math:`\beta` are set to 0. At train time in the forward pass, the
    standard-deviation is calculated via the biased estimator, equivalent to
    ``torch.var(input, unbiased=False)``. However, the value stored in the moving average of the
    standard-deviation is calculated via the unbiased  estimator, equivalent to
    ``torch.var(input, unbiased=True)``.

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
    computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
    evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default :attr:`momentum`
    of 0.1.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``False``, this layer then does not
    keep running estimates, and batch statistics are instead used during
    evaluation time as well.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momentum} \times x_t`,
        where :math:`\hat{x}` is the estimated statistic and :math:`x_t` is the
        new observed value.

    Because the Batch Normalization is done over the `C` dimension, computing statistics
    on `(N, D, H, W)` slices, it's common terminology to call this Volumetric Batch Normalization
    or Spatio-temporal Batch Normalization.
