class Dropout(Module):
    r"""During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input
    tensor with probability *p* using samples from a bernoulli distribution.
    The elements to zero are randomized on every forward call.

    This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and
    preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper
    `Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature
    detectors`_ .

    Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of *1/(1-p)* during
    training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
        inplace: If set to True, will do this operation in-place. Default: false

    Shape:
        - Input: `Any`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: `Same`. Output is of the same shape as input

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.Dropout(p=0.2)
        >>> input = autograd.Variable(torch.randn(20, 16))
        >>> output = m(input)

class AlphaDropout(Module):
    r"""Applies Alpha Dropout over the input.

    Alpha Dropout is a type of Dropout that maintains the self-normalizing
    property.
    For an input with zero mean and unit standard deviation, the output of
    Alpha Dropout maintains the original mean and standard deviation of the
    input.
    Alpha Dropout goes hand-in-hand with SELU activation function, which ensures
    that the outputs have zero mean and unit standard deviation.

    During training, it randomly masks some of the elements of the input
    tensor with probability *p* using samples from a bernoulli distribution.
    The elements to masked are randomized on every forward call, and scaled
    and shifted to maintain zero mean and unit standard deviation.

    During evaluation the module simply computes an identity function.

    More details can be found in the paper `Self-Normalizing Neural Networks`_ .

    Args:
        p (float): probability of an element to be dropped. Default: 0.5

        - Input: `Any`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: `Same`. Output is of the same shape as input
