# [Note: Recording ShapeEnv Events]
# =================================
#
# What is a ShapeEnv event?
# -------------------------
# We consider a ShapeEnv event every function call (ShapeEnv method or
# independent function) that modifies the state of the ShapeEnv instance.
# Such calls are recorded alongside their positional and keyword arguments,
# so that it may be replayed over a different ShapeEnv instance.
#
# See [Note: ShapeEnv State Equality] for what is considered the state
# of a ShapeEnv instance.
#
# What is it for?
# ---------------
# ShapeEnv events recording is used for reconstructing the ShapeEnv in an
# arbitrary state in time.
#
# Being able to arbitrarily replay events like so is useful, mainly for
# translation validation bisection. i.e. if a ValidationException has been
# raised, find the earliest point in time where the translation validation
# fails.
#
# Besides that, it also allows us to inspect the given instance and,
# for example, check the guards that would actually be issued at that point.
#
# What kind of arguments can be stored in an event?
# -------------------------------------------------
# There's no specific rule for what cannot be used as an argument.
# That said, pay special attention to the following cases:
#
#   1. Tensor inputs: there are some tests that check whether the inputs
#      were garbage collected after execution. These will fail if there's
#      an event that is holding a reference to those inputs.
#
#   2. ShapeEnv arguments: if there is an argument of ShapeEnv type, that
#      will be automatically replaced by the new given ShapeEnv instance.
#
#   3. SymTypes arguments: they also hold references to ShapeEnv. So,
#      whenever we see them, we create a new instance, replacing the
#      ShapeEnv reference.
#
#   4. FX nodes: specifically, FX nodes from the FX graph for symbolic
#      shapes. That argument must be replaced when replaying the event at
#      ShapeEnvEvent.run, since it has to reference a node from the given
#      instance, and not from the recorded instance.

# issued guards, when ShapeEnv.produce_guards is called.

# [Note: ShapeEnv State Equality]
# ===============================
#
# What is considered ShapeEnv state?
# ----------------------------------
# We consider to be the state of a ShapeEnv instance everything that
# is not in the inline tuple inside remove_nonstate_variables function.
# That is: the fields within ShapeEnv that modify the flow of execution
# of the program.
#
# So, for example: the replacements field might influence on how an
# expression is simplified. That, in turn, may result in a guard being
# statically known (i.e. not added).
#
# On the other hand, var_to_stack serves only changes what is printed
# in the screen, i.e. used only for debugging purposes. Therefore, we
# should not consider it when comparing states.
#
# What to do on NotEqualError?
# ----------------------------
# Here are a few possible causes for getting a NotEqualError raised:
#
#   1. New field that does not belong in the ShapeEnv state.
#      For example: log field of type ShapeEnvLoggerAdapter. Different
#      ShapeEnv instances will always have different ShapeEnvLoggerAdapter
#      instances, i.e. equality comparison would fail.
#      Solution: add it to the inlined tuple inside remove_nonstate_variables
#      function inside check_equal method.
#
#   2. New field that is not directly comparable across instances.
#      For example: guards field of type List[ShapeGuard]. More specifically,
#      the ShapeGuard type holds an expression and a stack information
#      for debugging purposes. When replaying the even on a new ShapeEnv
#      instance, the stack would be different, which would trigger this error.
#      Solution: add a special case to the map_value function inside
#      check_equal function.
#
#   3. Mutation of ShapeEnv on some not recorded function.
#      If a mutation of the state of ShapeEnv happens inside a function
#      that is not recorded (or that no caller in the stack is recorded),
#      then, the replayed ShapeEnv won't catch that.
#      Solution: decorate the function with record_shape_env_event.
