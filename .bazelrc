# Disable all warnings for external repositories. We don't care about
# their warnings.
build --per_file_copt=^external/@-w

# Set additional warnings to error level.
#
# Implementation notes:
#  * we use file extensions to determine if we are using the C++
#    compiler or the cuda compiler
#  * we use ^// at the start of the regex to only permit matching
#    PyTorch files. This excludes external repos.
#
# Note that because this is logically a command-line flag, it is
# considered the word on what warnings are enabled. This has the
# unfortunate consequence of preventing us from disabling an error at
# the target level because those flags will come before these flags in
# the action invocation. Instead we provide per-file exceptions after
# this.
#
# On the bright side, this means we don't have to more broadly apply
# the exceptions to an entire target.
#
# Looking for CUDA flags? We have a cu_library macro that we can edit
# directly. Look in //tools/rules:cu.bzl for details. Editing the
# macro over this has the following advantages:
#  * making changes does not require discarding the Bazel analysis
#    cache
#  * it allows for selective overrides on individual targets since the
#    macro-level opts will come earlier than target level overrides

# missing-field-parameters has both a large number of violations in
# the codebase, but it also is used pervasively in the Python C
# API. There are a couple of catches though:
# * we use multiple versions of the Python API and hence have
#   potentially multiple different versions of each relevant
#   struct. They may have different numbers of fields. It will be
#   unwieldy to support multiple versions in the same source file.
# * Python itself for many of these structs recommends only
#   initializing a subset of the fields. We should respect the API
#   usage conventions of our dependencies.
#
# Hence, we just disable this warning altogether. We may want to clean
# up some of the clear-cut cases that could be risky, but we still
# likely want to have this disabled for the most part.
