# Add GPU vs CPU Performance Benchmarking Utilities

## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive performance benchmarking utilities to PyTorch, enabling users to compare GPU and CPU performance for matrix operations and neural network training across different devices (CUDA, MPS, CPU).

## Motivation

PyTorch users frequently need to:
- Validate their PyTorch installation works correctly
- Understand GPU vs CPU performance trade-offs for their hardware
- Benchmark PyTorch operations for optimization decisions
- Verify GPU acceleration is working as expected

Currently, there's no standardized way to perform these benchmarks within PyTorch itself.

## Changes Made

### New Files Added:

1. **`benchmarks/performance_tests/gpu_cpu_benchmark.py`**
   - Main benchmarking utilities with modular class structure
   - Device detection (CUDA > MPS > CPU priority)
   - Matrix multiplication benchmarking with proper GPU synchronization
   - Neural network training benchmarking
   - Structured performance reporting

2. **`test/test_utils/test_performance_utils.py`**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all benchmark utilities
   - Device-specific test cases (CPU, CUDA, MPS)
   - Integration tests for full benchmark runs
   - Edge case handling verification

3. **`tools/testing/run_performance_tests.sh`**
   - Automated test runner script
   - Environment detection and setup
   - Flexible test execution options

## Features

- âœ… **Cross-platform support**: Works with NVIDIA CUDA, Apple MPS, and CPU
- âœ… **Proper GPU synchronization**: Accurate timing with device synchronization
- âœ… **Modular design**: Easily extensible for additional benchmark types
- âœ… **Comprehensive testing**: Full unit test coverage
- âœ… **Type hints**: Complete type annotations for better IDE support
- âœ… **Documentation**: Detailed docstrings and usage examples

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
python -m pytest test/test_utils/test_performance_utils.py -v
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
python benchmarks/performance_tests/gpu_cpu_benchmark.py
```

### Example Output
