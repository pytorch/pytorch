    Notes
    -----
    FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
    calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
    the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.

    The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
    the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

    Compute the one-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
    discrete Fourier transform computed by `fft`.  In other words,
    ``ifft(fft(a)) == a`` to within numerical accuracy.
    For a general description of the algorithm and definitions,
    see `numpy.fft`.

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `fft`,
    i.e.,

    * ``a[0]`` should contain the zero frequency term,
    * ``a[1:n//2]`` should contain the positive-frequency terms,
    * ``a[n//2 + 1:]`` should contain the negative-frequency terms, in
      increasing order starting from the most negative frequency.

    For an even number of input points, ``A[n//2]`` represents the sum of
    the values at the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies, as the two
    are aliased together. See `numpy.fft` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.

        axis is used.

    Notes
    -----
    If the input parameter `n` is larger than the size of the input, the input
    is padded by appending zeros at the end.  Even though this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If a different padding is

    fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
    rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    When the DFT is computed for purely real input, the output is
    Hermitian-symmetric, i.e. the negative frequency terms are just the complex
    conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
    negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant.  This function does not
    compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
    axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.

    When ``A = rfft(a)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``A[0]`` contains
    the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.

    If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
    and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
    real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
    the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
    general case.

    If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.fft.fft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.+1.j]) # may vary
    >>> np.fft.rfft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j]) # may vary

    Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
    of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
    exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

        ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the length of the transformed axis of the
        input. To get an odd number of output points, `n` must be specified.

    Raises

        If `axis` is not a valid axis of `a`.

    irfftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform
    of `a`, where `a` contains the non-negative frequency terms of a
    Hermitian-symmetric sequence. `n` is the length of the result, not the
    input.

    If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the
    extra/removed values will be added/removed at high frequencies. One can
    thus resample a series to `m` points via Fourier interpolation by:
    ``a_resamp = irfft(rfft(a), m)``.

    The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the length of
    the original data, as given by `n`. This is because each input shape could
    correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `irfft`
    assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
    frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry,
    the value is thus treated as purely real. To avoid losing information, the
    correct length of the real input **must** be given.

    array([0.,  1.,  0.,  0.])

    Notice how the last term in the input to the ordinary `ifft` is the
    complex conjugate of the second term, and the output has zero imaginary
    part everywhere.  When calling `irfft`, the negative frequencies are not
    specified, and the output array is purely real.

    ihfft : The inverse of `hfft`.

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd.

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1)) == a``, within roundoff error.

    The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the length of
    the original data, as given by `n`. This is because each input shape could
    correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `hfft`
    assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
    frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry,
    the value is thus treated as purely real. To avoid losing information, the
    shape of the full signal **must** be given.

            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
        axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the transform over that axis is

    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
        ``len(s) != 2``.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    -----
    `fft2` is just `fftn` with a different default for `axes`.

    The output, analogously to `fft`, contains the term for zero frequency in
    the low-order corner of the transformed axes, the positive frequency terms
    in the first half of these axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the
    middle of the axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of
    the axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    This function computes the inverse of the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier
    Transform over any number of axes in an M-dimensional array by means of
    the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In other words, ``ifft2(fft2(a)) == a``
    to within numerical accuracy.  By default, the inverse transform is
    computed over the last two axes of the input array.

    The input, analogously to `ifft`, should be ordered in the same way as is

    in the low-order corner of the two axes, the positive frequency terms in
    the first half of these axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the
    middle of the axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each axis) of the output (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0,
        ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).  This corresponds to `n` for ``ifft(x, n)``.
        Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped. If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0

            If it is ``-1``, the whole input is used (no padding/trimming).

        If `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.  See notes for issue on `ifft` zero padding.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is not ``None``, `axes` must not be ``None`` either.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            `s` must contain only ``int`` s, not ``None`` values. ``None``
            values currently mean that the default value for ``n`` is used
            in the corresponding 1-D transform, but this behaviour is
            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
        axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
        that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
        that a one-dimensional FFT is performed. Default: ``(-2, -1)``.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is specified, the corresponding `axes` to be transformed
            must not be ``None``.

    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : complex ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype for all axes (and hence is
        incompatible with passing in all but the trivial ``s``).

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and

    Zero-padding, analogously with `ifft`, is performed by appending zeros to
    the input along the specified dimension.  Although this is the common

    padding is desired, it must be performed before `ifft2` is called.

        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of each transformed axis is as given by the corresponding
        element of `s`, or the length of the input in every axis except for the
        last one if `s` is not given.  In the final transformed axis the length

    Notes

    See `fft` for definitions and conventions used.

    See `rfft` for definitions and conventions used for real input.

    The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the shape of
    the original data, as given by `s`. This is because each input shape could
    correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `irfftn`
    assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
    frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. When performing the
    final complex to real transform, the last value is thus treated as purely
    real. To avoid losing information, the correct shape of the real input
    **must** be given.

    Computes the inverse of `rfft2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the real output to the inverse FFT.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0

            If it is ``-1``, the whole input is used (no padding/trimming).

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is not ``None``, `axes` must not be ``None`` either.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            `s` must contain only ``int`` s, not ``None`` values. ``None``
            values currently mean that the default value for ``n`` is used
            in the corresponding 1-D transform, but this behaviour is
            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default: ``(-2, -1)``, the last two axes.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is specified, the corresponding `axes` to be transformed
            must not be ``None``.

    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype for the last transformation.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the inverse real 2-D FFT.

    See Also
    --------
    rfft2 : The forward two-dimensional FFT of real input,
            of which `irfft2` is the inverse.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT for real input.
    irfft : The inverse of the one-dimensional FFT of real input.
    irfftn : Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    This is really `irfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `irfftn`.

    --------

    >>> a = np.mgrid[:5, :5][0]
