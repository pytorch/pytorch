==========
Hypothesis
==========

Hypothesis is an advanced testing library for Python. It lets you write tests which
are parametrized by a source of examples, and then generates simple and comprehensible
examples that make your tests fail. This lets you find more bugs in your code with less
work.

e.g.

.. code-block:: python

  @given(st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False), min_size=1))
  def test_mean(xs):
      assert min(xs) <= mean(xs) <= max(xs)

.. code-block::

  Falsifying example: test_mean(
    xs=[1.7976321109618856e+308, 6.102390043022755e+303]
  )

Hypothesis is extremely practical and advances the state of the art of
unit testing by some way. It's easy to use, stable, and powerful. If
you're not using Hypothesis to test your project then you're missing out.
