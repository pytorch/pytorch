## Typing stubs for dataclasses

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `dataclasses` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `dataclasses`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/dataclasses. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-dataclasses` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ec7ab6d4d6147adf01565d3b2bb2ae4d750f6b1e`.
