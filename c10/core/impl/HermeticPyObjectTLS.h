    //  - The first interpreter is indifferent whether or not it sees
    //    hasState true/false; obviously false works (this is what the
    //    interpreter was previously using; more directly, the interpreter
    //    calls into itself as the handler, so being hermetic is not
    //    required), and true simply means serviced python operator calls will
    //    be hermetic; in these cases it is expected to be functionally
    //    equivalent.
    //
    //  - The second interpreter MUST see hasState true (as its requests will
    //    be forwarded to the first interpreter), but it is assumed that there
    //    is a synchronization between the interpreter initialization, and
    //    when we actually perform operations, so it is guaranteed to see
    //    hasState true.
