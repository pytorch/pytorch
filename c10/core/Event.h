/**
 * A backend-generic movable, not copyable, not thread-safe event.
 *
 * The design of this event follows that of CUDA and HIP events. These events
 * are recorded and waited on by streams and can be rerecorded to,
 * each rerecording essentially creating a new version of the event.
 * For example, if (in CPU time), stream X is asked to record E,
 * stream Y waits on E, and stream X is asked to record E again, then Y will
 * wait for X to finish the first call to record and not the second, because
 * it's waiting on the first version of event E, not the second.
 * Querying an event only returns the status of its most recent version.
 *
 * Backend-generic events are implemented by this class and
 * impl::InlineEvent. In addition to these events there are also
 * some backend-specific events, like ATen's CUDAEvent. Each of these
 * classes has its own use.
 *
 * impl::InlineEvent<...> or a backend-specific event should be
 * preferred when the backend is known at compile time and known to
 * be compiled. Backend-specific events may have additional functionality.
 *
 * This Event should be used if a particular backend may not be available,
 * or the backend required is not known at compile time.
 *
 * These generic events are built on top of DeviceGuardImpls, analogous
 * to DeviceGuard and InlineDeviceGuard. The name "DeviceGuardImpls,"
 * is no longer entirely accurate, as these classes implement the
 * backend-specific logic for a generic backend interface.
 *
 * See DeviceGuardImplInterface.h for a list of all supported flags.
