/**
 * A OptionalDeviceGuard is an RAII class that sets a device to some value on
 * initialization, and resets the device to its original value on destruction.
 * Morally, a OptionalDeviceGuard is equivalent to std::optional<DeviceGuard>,
 * but with extra constructors and methods as appropriate.
 *
 * Besides its obvious use (optionally applying a DeviceGuard),
 * OptionalDeviceGuard is often also used for the following idiom:
 *
 *    OptionalDeviceGuard g;
 *    for (const auto& t : tensors) {
 *      g.set_device(t.device());
 *      do_something_with(t);
 *    }
 *
 * This usage is marginally more efficient than constructing a DeviceGuard every
 * iteration of the for loop, as it avoids an unnecessary device reset.
 *
 * Unlike DeviceGuard, a OptionalDeviceGuard may be uninitialized.  This occurs
 * when you use the nullary constructor, or pass a nullopt to the constructor.
 * Uninitialized OptionalDeviceGuards do *nothing*; they do not know what the
 * original device was and they do not reset on destruction.  This is why
 * original_device() and current_device() return std::optional<Device> rather
 * than Device (as they do in DeviceGuard), and also is why we didn't just
 * provide OptionalDeviceGuard by default and hide DeviceGuard from users.
 *
 * The semantics of an OptionalDeviceGuard are exactly explained by thinking
 * of it as an std::optional<DeviceGuard>.  In particular, an initialized
 * OptionalDeviceGuard doesn't restore device to its value at construction; it
 * restores device to its value *at initialization*.  So if you have the
 * program:
 *
 *     setDevice(1);
 *     OptionalDeviceGuard g;
 *     setDevice(2);
 *     g.reset_device(Device(DeviceType::CUDA, 3));  // initializes!
 *
 * On destruction, g will reset device to 2, rather than 1.
 *
 * An uninitialized OptionalDeviceGuard is distinct from a (initialized)
 * DeviceGuard whose original_device_ and current_device_ match, since the
 * DeviceGuard will still reset the device to original_device_.

//
// using DeviceGuard = impl::InlineDeviceGuard<impl::VirtualGuardImpl>;
// using OptionalDeviceGuard =
// impl::InlineOptionalDeviceGuard<impl::VirtualGuardImpl>;
//
// But the error messages are worse, and our users can't just look at the
// header file to find out what's going on.  Furthermore, for specializations
// like CUDAStreamGuard, it can be profitable to replace some interfaces with
// refined types (e.g., return CUDAStream instead of Stream).  So, we eat
// the boilerplate and write out the API explicitly.
