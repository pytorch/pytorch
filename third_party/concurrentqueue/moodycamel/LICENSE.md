This license file applies to everything in this repository except that which
is explicitly annotated as being written by other authors, i.e. the Boost
queue (included in the benchmarks for comparison), Intel's TBB library (ditto),
dlib::pipe (ditto),
the CDSChecker tool (used for verification), the Relacy model checker (ditto),
and Jeff Preshing's semaphore implementation (used in the blocking queue) which
has a zlib license (embedded in lightweightsempahore.h).
