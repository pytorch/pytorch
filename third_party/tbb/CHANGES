    uses __atomic_* built-ins instead of the legacy __sync_* ones.
    This change is inspired by a contribution from Mathieu Malaterre.
- Improvements in task_arena:
    Several application threads may join a task_arena and execute tasks
    simultaneously. The amount of concurrency reserved for application
    threads at task_arena construction can be set to any value between
    0 and the arena concurrency limit.
- The fractal example was modified to demonstrate class task_arena
    and moved to examples/task_arena/fractal.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed a deadlock during destruction of task_scheduler_init objects
    when one of destructors is set to wait for worker threads.
- Added a workaround for a possible crash on OS X* when dynamic memory
    allocator replacement (libtbbmalloc_proxy) is used and memory is
    released during application startup.
- Usage of mutable functors with task_group::run_and_wait() and
    task_arena::enqueue() is disabled. An attempt to pass a functor
    which operator()() is not const will produce compilation errors.

Preview Features:

- Class task_arena no longer requires linking with a preview library,
    though still remains a community preview feature.
- The method task_arena::wait_until_empty() is removed.
- The method task_arena::current_slot() now returns -1 if
    the task scheduler is not initialized in the thread.

Changes affecting backward compatibility:

- Because of changes in internal layout of graph nodes, the namespace
    interface number of flow::graph has been incremented from 6 to 7.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed a race in lazy initialization of task_arena.
- Fixed flow::graph::reset() to prevent situations where tasks would be
    spawned in the process of resetting the graph to its initial state.
- Fixed decrement bug in limiter_node.
- Fixed a race in arc deletion in the flow graph.

Open-source contributions integrated:

- Improved support for IBM* Blue Gene* by Raf Schietekat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel TBB 4.2
TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 7000

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.1 Update 4):

- Added speculative_spin_mutex, which uses Intel(R) Transactional
    Synchronization Extensions when they are supported by hardware.
- Binary files linked with libc++ (the C++ standard library in Clang)

    See an example in
    examples/GettingStarted/sub_string_finder/Makefile.
- Various improvements in source code, scripts and makefiles.

Changes affecting backward compatibility:

- tbb::flow::graph has been modified to spawn its tasks;
    the old behaviour (task enqueuing) is deprecated. This change may
    impact applications that expected a flow graph to make progress
    without calling wait_for_all(), which is no longer guaranteed. See
    the documentation for more details.
- Changed the return values of the scalable_allocation_mode() function.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed a leak of parallel_reduce body objects when execution is
    cancelled or an exception is thrown, as suggested by Darcy Harrison.

    Windows* OS package.
- Exact exception propagation (exception_ptr) support on Linux OS is
    now turned on by default for GCC 4.4 and higher.
- Stopped implicit use of large memory pages by tbbmalloc (Linux-only).
    Now use of large pages must be explicitly enabled with
    scalable_allocation_mode() function or TBB_MALLOC_USE_HUGE_PAGES
    environment variable.

Community Preview Features:

- Extended class task_arena constructor and method initialize() to
    allow some concurrency to be reserved strictly for application

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel TBB 4.1 Update 2
TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 6102

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.1 Update 1):

- Objects up to 128 MB are now cached by the tbbmalloc. Previously
    the threshold was 8MB. Objects larger than 128 MB are still
    processed by direct OS calls.
- concurrent_unordered_multiset and concurrent_unordered_multimap
    have been added, based on Microsoft* PPL prototype.
- Ability to value-initialize a tbb::atomic<T> variable on construction
    in C++11, with const expressions properly supported.

Community Preview Features:

- Added a possibility to wait until all worker threads terminate.
    This is necessary before calling fork() from an application.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed data race in tbbmalloc that might lead to memory leaks
    for large object allocations.
- Fixed task_arena::enqueue() to use task_group_context of target arena.
- Improved implementation of 64 bit atomics on ia32.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel TBB 4.1 Update 1
TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 6101

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.1):

- concurrent_vector class now supports initialization/assignment
    via C++11 initializer list feature (std::initializer_list<T>)
- Added implementation of the platform isolation layer based on
    Intel compiler atomic built-ins; it is supposed to work on
    any platform supported by compiler version 12.1 and newer.
- Using GetNativeSystemInfo() instead of GetSystemInfo() to support
    more than 32 processors for 32-bit applications under WOW64.
- The following form of parallel_for:
    parallel_for(first, last, [step,] f[, context]) now accepts an
    optional partitioner parameter after the function f.

Backward-incompatible API changes:

- The library no longer injects tuple in to namespace std.
    In previous releases, tuple was injected into namespace std by
    flow_graph.h when std::tuple was not available.  In this release,
    flow_graph.h now uses tbb::flow::tuple.  On platforms where
    std::tuple is available, tbb::flow::tuple is typedef'ed to
    std::tuple.  On all other platforms, tbb::flow::tuple provides
    a subset of the functionality defined by std::tuple. Users of
    flow_graph.h may need to change their uses of std::tuple to
    tbb::flow::tuple to ensure compatibility with non-C++11 compliant
    compilers.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed local observer to be able to override propagated CPU state and
    to provide correct value of task_arena::current_slot() in callbacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel TBB 4.1
TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 6100

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.0 Update 5):

- _WIN32_WINNT must be set to 0x0501 or greater in order to use TBB
    on Microsoft* Windows*.
- parallel_deterministic_reduce template function is fully supported.
- TBB headers can be used with C++0x/C++11 mode (-std=c++0x) of GCC
    and Intel(R) Compiler.
- C++11 std::make_exception_ptr is used where available, instead of
    std::copy_exception from earlier C++0x implementations.
- Improvements in the TBB allocator to reduce extra memory consumption.
- Partial refactoring of the task scheduler data structures.
- TBB examples allow more flexible specification of the thread number,
    including arithmetic and geometric progression.

Bugs fixed:

- On Linux & OS X*, pre-built TBB binaries do not yet support exact
    exception propagation via C++11 exception_ptr. To prevent run time
    errors, by default TBB headers disable exact exception propagation
    even if the C++ implementation provides exception_ptr.

Community Preview Features:

- Added: class task_arena, for work submission by multiple application
    threads with thread-independent control of concurrency level.
- Added: task_scheduler_observer can be created as local to a master
    thread, to observe threads that work on behalf of that master.
    Local observers may have new on_scheduler_leaving() callback.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel TBB 4.0 Update 5
TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 6005

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.0 Update 4):

- Parallel pipeline optimization (directly storing small objects in the
    interstage data buffers) limited to trivially-copyable types for
    C++11 and a short list of types for earlier compilers.
- _VARIADIC_MAX switch is honored for TBB tuple implementation
    and flow::graph nodes based on tuple.
- Support of Cocoa framework was added to the GUI examples on OS X*
    systems.

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.0 Update 3):

- The TBB memory allocator transparently supports large pages on Linux.
- A new flow_graph example, logic_sim, was added.
- Support for DirectX* 9 was added to GUI examples.

Community Preview Features:

- Added: aggregator, a new concurrency control mechanism.

Bugs fixed:

- The abort operation on concurrent_bounded_queue now leaves the queue
    in a reusable state. If a bad_alloc or bad_last_alloc exception is
    thrown while the queue is recovering from an abort, that exception
    will be reported instead of user_abort on the thread on which it
    occurred, and the queue will not be reusable.
- Steal limiting heuristic fixed to avoid premature stealing disabling
    when large amount of __thread data is allocated on thread stack.
- Fixed a low-probability leak of arenas in the task scheduler.
- In STL-compatible allocator classes, the method construct() was fixed
    to comply with C++11 requirements.
- Fixed a bug that prevented creation of fixed-size memory pools
    smaller than 2M.
- Significantly reduced the amount of warnings from various compilers.

Open-source contributions integrated:

- Multiple improvements by Raf Schietekat.

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.0 Update 2):

- Modifications to the low-level API for memory pools:
    added support for aligned allocations;
    pool policies reworked to allow backward-compatible extensions;
    added a policy to not return memory space till destruction;
    pool_reset() does not return memory space anymore.
- Class tbb::flow::graph_iterator added to iterate over all nodes
    registered with a graph instance.
- multioutput_function_node has been renamed multifunction_node.
    multifunction_node and split_node are now fully-supported features.
- For the tagged join node, the policy for try_put of an item with
    already existing tag has been defined: the item will be rejected.
- Matching the behavior on Windows, on other platforms the optional
    shared libraries (libtbbmalloc, libirml) now are also searched
    only in the directory where libtbb is located.
- The platform isolation layer based on GCC built-ins is extended.

Backward-incompatible API changes:

- a graph reference parameter is now required to be passed to the
    constructors of the following flow graph nodes: overwrite_node,
    write_once_node, broadcast_node, and the CPF or_node.
- the following tbb::flow node methods and typedefs have been renamed:
       Old                             New
    join_node and or_node:
       inputs()                 ->     input_ports()
       input_ports_tuple_type   ->     input_ports_type
    multifunction_node and split_node:
       ports_type               ->     output_ports_type

Bugs fixed:

- Not all logical processors were utilized on systems with more than
    64 cores split by Windows into several processor groups.

TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION == 6002

Changes (w.r.t. Intel TBB 4.0 Update 1 commercial-aligned release):

- concurrent_bounded_queue now has an abort() operation that releases
    threads involved in pending push or pop operations. The released
    threads will receive a tbb::user_abort exception.
- Added Community Preview Feature:  concurrent_lru_cache container,
    a concurrent implementation of LRU (least-recently-used) cache.

Bugs fixed:

- fixed a race condition in the TBB scalable allocator.
- concurrent_queue counter wraparound bug was fixed, which occurred when
    the number of push and pop operations exceeded ~>4 billion on IA32.
- fixed races in the TBB scheduler that could put workers asleep too
    early, especially in presence of affinitized tasks.

- Preview of new flow graph nodes:
    or_node (accepts multiple inputs, forwards each input separately
      to all successors),
    split_node (accepts tuples, and forwards each element of a tuple
      to a corresponding successor), and
    multioutput_function_node (accepts one input, and passes the input
    and a tuple of output ports to the function body to support outputs
    to multiple successors).
- Added: memory pools for more control on memory source, grouping,
    and collective deallocation.

    of files for each VS version, now there is single 'msvs' directory
    that contains workspaces for MS C++ compiler (<example>_cl.sln) and
    Intel C++ compiler (<example>_icl.sln). Works with VS 2005 and above.
