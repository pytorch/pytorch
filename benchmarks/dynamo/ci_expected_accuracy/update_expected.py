"""
Update commited CSV files used as reference points by dynamo/inductor CI.

Currently only cares about graph breaks, so only saves those columns.

Hardcodes a list of job names and artifacts per job, but builds the lookup
by querying github sha and finding associated github actions workflow ID and CI jobs,
downloading artifact zips, extracting CSVs and filtering them.

Usage:

python benchmarks/dynamo/ci_expected_accuracy.py <sha of pytorch commit that has completed inductor benchmark jobs>

Known limitations:
- doesn't handle 'retry' jobs in CI, if the same hash has more than one set of artifacts, gets the first one
