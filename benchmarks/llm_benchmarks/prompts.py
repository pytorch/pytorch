    "<s>Marseille, France (CNN)The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight "
    "9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille "
    'prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A '
    "person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\" Robin's comments follow claims "
    "by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final "
    "seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. "
    "Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two "
    "publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that "
    "they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \"One can hear cries of 'My God' "
    'in several languages," Paris Match reported. "Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, '
    "perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy "
    'shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing." "It is a very disturbing scene," '
    "said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, "
    "the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie "
    "spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the "
    'reports were "completely wrong" and "unwarranted." Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, '
    'but that they "hadn\'t been exploited yet." Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent '
    "to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized "
    "technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent "
    "to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card "
    'to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical "no." Reichelt told "Erin Burnett: Outfront" that he '
    'had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are "very confident" that the clip '
    "is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after "
    'Bild and Paris Match published their reports. "That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can '
    "say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. What "
    "was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas "
    "Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's "
    "accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training "
    'school in 2009 that he had a "previous episode of severe depression," the airline said Tuesday. Email '
    "correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, "
    "included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement "
    "indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed "
    "him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously "
    'said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a "swift and seamless clarification" and '
    "said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public "
    "prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past "
    "week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center "
    "set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving "
    "families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human "
    "remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, "
    "speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the "
    "end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the "
    "victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be "
    "more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our "
    "correspondents . The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were "
    "among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's "
    "possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid "
    'medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and "held all the licenses required." Earlier, a '
    "spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz "
    "suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before "
    "he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting "
    "aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition "
    "would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told "
    'CNN on Tuesday. While flying was "a big part of his life," the source said, it\'s only one theory being '
    "considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that "
    "authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not "
    "be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye "
    "doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had "
    "psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his "
    "previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. "
    '"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they '
    "weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But "
    "there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it "
    "outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Germanwings crash compensation: "
    "What we know . Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? CNN's Margot Haddad reported from Marseille and "
    "Pamela Brown from Dusseldorf, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Pamela "
    "Boykoff, Antonia Mortensen, Sandrine Amiel and Anna-Maja Rappard contributed to this report."
